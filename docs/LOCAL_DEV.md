# Running Draazy locally (frontend + backend + Postgres)

How to run the full stack on one machine.

**The backend is not optional.** `services/config.js` resolves every domain to the live API, and no
environment variable can route a domain anywhere else.
Run both halves, or the catalogue renders empty.

This page covers the first tier only. For how `local` relates to `local,e2e`, `sandbox` and
`prod` — and why `prod,local` is the one combination that refuses to boot — see
[`system/profiles.md`](./system/profiles.md).

---

## 1. Postgres

Two databases, and they must stay separate:

| Database | Used by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `draazy` | local dev / running the app | Flyway schema **+ demo data**, both built by Flyway |
| `draazy_test` | `mvn verify` | Flyway schema only, **kept empty of demo data** |

The test suite asserts exact row counts against a schema Flyway built from empty. Pointing dev at
`draazy_test` seeds it and breaks the suite with confusing `expected 2, got 18` failures.

```powershell
$env:PGPASSWORD = 'postgres'
$psql = 'C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin\psql.exe'
& $psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE draazy;"
& $psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE draazy_test;"
```

Both are built entirely by Flyway on first boot. **The dev database is now reproducible**: boot the
backend against an empty `draazy` and you get the schema *and* the 38-listing demo catalogue. That
was not true before 2026-08-04 — the demo data existed only inside one database and no script could
regenerate it (tech-debt D81, now closed).

### How the schema changes: Flyway only, forward only

The rules, in the order they bite:

1. **Never edit a migration that has been applied anywhere.** Flyway records a checksum per file. A
   one-character edit to an applied versioned script means every existing database refuses to boot with
   `Migration checksum mismatch`. This is not theoretical — it is exactly what happened on
   2026-08-04, and repairing it was impossible because the database was also twenty versions behind.
2. **New change → new script, named `<yy>.<mm>.<seq>__<description>.sql`** — e.g.
   `26.11.01__DDL_add_x.sql`, then `26.11.02__…`; the sequence restarts at `01` each month. There is
   no `V` prefix (`spring.flyway.sql-migration-prefix` is empty). Never renumber, never reuse, and keep
   every part two digits: Flyway compares versions numerically, so `26.10.1` and `26.10.01` collide.
3. **Never truncate or drop the schema to get out of trouble.** If a migration is wrong, write the
   next one that corrects it.
4. **`R__` (repeatable) is for content, not structure** — the two seeds. They re-run whenever their
   checksum changes and always after every versioned script, which is what makes editing the demo
   catalogue a one-file change rather than a new migration.

The chain has been flattened twice. On 2026-09-01 the 127-file `V1..V128` chain became 14
domain-grouped files. On 2026-10-13 the `V01..V129` chain (15 domain files plus 110 deltas, and the
pending society-community drop) was folded into the 14 files `26.10.01__DDL_foundation.sql` …
`26.10.14__DDL_flatmate_search.sql`, and the naming moved to `<yy>.<mm>.<seq>__`. Both times every
environment was rebuilt from empty, which is rule 1 again.

Equivalence was proved rather than assumed — the old chain and the new one were each replayed into a
scratch database and their `pg_dump --schema-only` and seeded reference data compared: identical
except five `trg_set_updated_at` triggers the old chain never installed on tables it created late
(`identity_verifications`, `conversation_user_state`, `property_verification_override_requests`,
`service_request_draft_approvals`, `service_request_draft_checks`). Every `ALTER TABLE` is folded into its `CREATE TABLE` (columns in the same physical
order), objects the chain created and later dropped are never created, and the backfill DML is gone:
every statement of it repaired rows that only exist in an already-populated database.

What this does **not** change: rule 1 still binds. The 14 files are applied everywhere now, so they
are as frozen as the old chain was. A future squash is possible on the same precondition.

Two build-time guards, because both mistakes above are invisible in review:

- `MigrationChainTest` fails if two migrations create the same table (which makes the chain
  un-replayable from empty) or claim the same version number.
- `TestDatabaseIsolationTest` fails if the demo seed ever reaches the test database.

### Where the demo data lives

`backend/src/main/resources/db/seed/R__zz_DML_dev_demo_data.sql` — 38 listings, 78 users, plus the
conversations, visits and contact requests that make the local app look like a product. Read its
header before changing it; it records three traps that cost real time (seed ordering, `ON CONFLICT`
scope, and one row that violated a constraint added after the data was created).

`db/seed-local/R__zz_DML_dev_kyc_desk.sql` fills the KYC desk (`/ops/kyc-review`) with 21 cases, one per
review state (overdue, claimed by others, QA sample, your own approval, rejected, revoked). Only
`application-local.properties` lists `db/seed-local`; the e2e profile replaces the list, so the lanes
never see it. `DevKycSeedImages` draws the placeholder document images on boot.

It is wired in `application-local.properties` as `spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration,classpath:db/seed`,
so **naming the `local` profile is what asks for it**. It used to sit in the base file and be excluded
in two places; that made it a denylist, and any deploy not called `prod` — `staging`, `preview`, or
one that named no profile — would have loaded 78 fabricated users and 38 fabricated listings into a
live catalogue. The one remaining exclusion is still load-bearing:

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `src/test/resources/application-local.properties` | the test run activates the `local` profile, and a profile-specific file outranks a plain one *from either source set* — so overriding this in the test's plain `application.properties` alone does not work. That was tried, and the suite died in Flyway before the first test |

To add a listing to the demo set: edit the seed, then recreate the local database (below). The seed is
`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so it inserts what is missing and never updates what is there.

### Rebuilding the local database

Safe to do at any time, and now lossless:

```powershell
# Optional but free: keep the old one until you are happy.
& $psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -c "ALTER DATABASE draazy RENAME TO draazy_old;"
& $psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE draazy;"
cd backend; .\mvnw.cmd -o spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local    # Flyway rebuilds schema + demo data
```

If you have added data locally that you care about, dump it first — it is not in the seed:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin\pg_dump.exe" -U postgres -h localhost -d draazy `
    --data-only --column-inserts -f "$env:USERPROFILE\draazy-backup.sql"
```

For the fixture ids and sample data, see [`docs/system/fixture-registry.md`](system/fixture-registry.md).
(This used to point at `backend/LOCAL_DB_STATUS.md`. That file is gitignored, so it only ever existed
on one machine; on every other checkout it was an empty stub pointing nowhere, which is how it was
found — the source-tree hygiene guard flagged it. The registry is tracked, so it cannot rot the same way.)

### How the test suite uses the database

Worth stating plainly, because the answer is not the usual one:

- **The database is long-lived, not created per run.** `draazy_test` is created once by hand.
  `mvn verify` connects to it, lets Flyway bring the schema up to date, and Hibernate validates the
  entity mapping against it (`ddl-auto=validate`) — so a green boot is itself a check that entities
  and migrations still agree.
- **Isolation comes from transaction rollback, not from a fresh database.** `AbstractApiTest` is
  `@Transactional`, so every test's writes are rolled back when it ends. That is why 733 tests can
  share one database and still assert exact row counts.
- **The standing exception is audit rows.** `AuditService` writes `REQUIRES_NEW`, which commits
  regardless of the caller's rollback — deliberately, since an audit trail that vanishes when a
  transaction fails is not an audit trail. A test that triggers one has to clean `audit_log` itself
  in an `@AfterEach`.
- **There is no Testcontainers.** Docker is unavailable in this environment (org sign-in
  enforcement), so tests run against the real local Postgres. The cost is that the suite needs
  infrastructure to be up; the benefit is that it runs against the actual engine, so `CHECK`
  constraints, `ON CONFLICT` and native queries are genuinely exercised rather than approximated.
- **Nothing verifies the chain replays from empty.** The suite only ever migrates *forward* from
  whatever `draazy_test` already contains, so a migration that cannot build a database from
  scratch stays green indefinitely — which is exactly how the duplicate `society_leads` in V7/V24
  survived. To check it, point the backend at a throwaway:

  ```powershell
  & $psql -U postgres -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE draazy_replay;"
  $env:DB_URL = 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/draazy_replay'
  cd backend; .\mvnw.cmd -o spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local     # look for "Successfully applied N migrations"
  ```

  Verified on 2026-08-04: all 31 migrations replay cleanly into an empty database.

## 2. Backend

### One-time setup: `DRAAZY_DEV_MACHINE`

Do this once per machine, before the first run:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('DRAAZY_DEV_MACHINE', '1', 'User')
```

Then **open a new terminal** — and restart VS Code, so the `backend: spring boot` task inherits it.

If you skip it, the backend refuses to start, and says so:

```
The 'local' profile is active but the DRAAZY_DEV_MACHINE environment variable is not set,
so nothing here proves this JVM is a developer's machine.
  On a developer machine: set DRAAZY_DEV_MACHINE=1 once in your user environment and start
  again — docs/LOCAL_DEV.md has the exact command. Nothing in the repository sets it for you:
  not run-local.ps1, not the VS Code task, not .env.local, because a control that a committed
  file can satisfy is not a control.
  On a server this failure is the control working, and setting the variable is the wrong fix: ...
```

**Why a variable and not a line in a file.** The `local` profile turns on three things that are
holes anywhere real: an OTP sender that prints the code to the log, a file store that writes KYC
documents to local disk, and `POST /me/verification/identity/simulate`, which hands the caller the
Verified badge that owners use to decide who may contact them. Everything that gated them was a
string in a file — and files are the thing deployments copy. A container that terminates its own
TLS (so it configures no proxy) and picks up `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local` from an environment file
someone copied off a laptop would otherwise be indistinguishable from a developer's machine as
far as the code could tell. It would boot green with all three live.

So the second signal is deliberately one that a file cannot carry. It is in no committed file, and
`run-local.ps1` actively refuses to read it out of `.env.local` even though that file is
git-ignored; a git-ignored file is still a file, and `.env` is the single most-copied artefact in a
deployment. The backend reads it with `System.getenv` rather than through Spring's `Environment`,
because Spring's relaxed binding would resolve `DRAAZY_DEV_MACHINE` from a `draazy.dev-machine`
entry in `application-local.properties` — which would put the whole thing straight back inside the
repository. The one action left is a human typing it on the machine it describes, which is exactly
the action a mis-provisioned deploy cannot perform by accident.

The old check is still there as a second, independent tripwire: `local` alongside `prod`, or `local`
with a load balancer configured in `draazy.security.trusted-proxies`, still kills the boot. It
catches the opposite mistake — someone who *has* exported the variable and then ships an image
built from their shell profile.

`mvn verify` is exempt, and does not need the variable. The suite activates `local` for all ~880 of
its tests (that is what wires the keyless providers they assert against), and the exemption keys on
`spring-boot-test` being on the classpath — a `test`-scoped dependency that is not in the packaged
application and that no file, flag or variable can switch on. The alternative was committing the
value somewhere for CI, which is the hole again.

### Running it

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Program Files\Zulu\zulu-25'
$env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

Or `.\run-local.ps1`, which pins the JDK, loads `.env.local`, and checks the variable above before
Maven spends a minute compiling.

**The `local` profile is not optional.** The mock OTP sender and the local-disk file store are opted
into by `local` rather than merely excluded from `prod` (D147), so a bare `mvn spring-boot:run` boots
with their production counterparts — which exist only to throw. The app starts and looks healthy;
you then cannot complete an OTP login or upload a document, and the failure reads as a 500 from the
endpoint rather than as a missing profile.

Serves `http://localhost:8080`. Defaults (all env-overridable via `DB_URL` / `DB_USER` /
`DB_PASSWORD` / `JWT_SECRET`) live in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. The `prod` profile
re-declares them as bare `${ENV}` lookups, so a missing secret fails the boot instead of silently
falling back to a well-known local value. It adds one more, `INTERNAL_PROXIES`, which must be a Java
regex matching the load balancer's addresses — the write rate limiter keys anonymous callers on the
client address, so a deploy that leaves this unanswered would put the whole internet in one bucket.
Locally the base file answers `none`, which is correct for a directly exposed app; the boot refuses
to start rather than guess. `ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET` works the same way: locally the base file answers
`none` (no proxy, no gate), and a deploy must supply the secret its edge proxy sends.

Confirm Flyway actually ran — a healthy boot logs:

```
o.f.core.internal.command.DbValidate : Successfully validated 17 migrations
c.draazy.api.DraazyApiApplication : Started DraazyApiApplication
```

That count is the 14 versioned `26.10.*__DDL_*` files plus the two `R__DML_*` reference seeds, and on the
`local`/`e2e` profiles the repeatables from `db/seed` and friends. On a database that is already at
26.10.14 the line reads *validated*; on an empty one you get `Migrating schema "public" to version
"26.10.14 - DDL flatmate search"` followed by `Successfully applied N migrations`.

If Flyway logs *nothing at all*, the `spring-boot-flyway` autoconfiguration module is missing from
`pom.xml`. Under Spring Boot 4, `flyway-core` alone is not enough.

### Getting an OTP locally

Login is passwordless mobile + OTP. The local `OtpSender` is a mock that prints the code to the backend
console rather than sending anything:

```
c.draazy.api.provider.MockOtpSender : [MOCK OTP] mobile=9876500001 code=993399
```

#### Sending a real WhatsApp message locally (optional)

ADR-020 delivers login codes as a WhatsApp `AUTHENTICATION` template. Meta publishes **no sandbox
host** — its free *test number* is a real number on the live Graph API — so the only way to exercise
real delivery is to turn the provider on under `local`. The flag deliberately wins over the profile:

```powershell
$env:WHATSAPP_ENABLED            = 'true'
$env:WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID    = '<numeric ID of the test number>'
$env:WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN       = '<System User token>'
$env:WHATSAPP_OTP_TEMPLATE_NAME  = '<approved AUTHENTICATION template name>'
$env:WHATSAPP_OTP_TEMPLATE_LANG  = 'en_US'
```

With the flag on, `MockOtpSender` steps aside and nothing is printed — the code only exists on the
handset. Turn it back off to get the console line back.

**A test number may only message five recipients**, each verified by hand in the App Dashboard, so
this cannot be used for the Playwright suite or for arbitrary seeded mobiles. It is a manual smoke
test on your own handset and nothing more; the automated suites stay on `MockOtpSender` and
`draazy.otp.fixed-code`. The token matters too: the one the App Dashboard shows on the WhatsApp
setup page **expires in 24 hours**, so generate a System User token with
`whatsapp_business_messaging` unless you enjoy re-pasting it daily.

Common failures, all of which surface as a 500 with the Graph error code in the backend log:
`131030` = recipient is not on the test number's allow-list; `132001` = no template by that
name/language; `133010` = the token's phone number is not registered.

#### Sending a real email locally (optional)

```powershell
$env:ZEPTOMAIL_ENABLED  = 'true'
$env:ZEPTOMAIL_API_KEY  = '<agent Send Mail token>'
```

Then create a staff account (or reissue an invite) at `/admin/team` with an inbox you own. With the flag
off the backend logs `[MOCK EMAIL] to=***@domain subject=...` and never the link.

On the corporate network the send logs `PKIX path building failed`: TLS is intercepted and Zulu's
`cacerts` lacks the corporate root. `run-local.ps1` starts the app JVM with
`-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT` so it trusts the Windows certificate store, the same one
`curl.exe` uses; add that flag yourself if you start the backend any other way. Production is unaffected.

## 3. Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

**The backend must be running** — see §2. Every domain resolves to the live API, so a frontend
started on its own serves the shell and then fails every request. Nothing masks that, which is the
point: for as long as a per-domain switch existed, "which backend am I actually talking
to?" was a question about a build, and a green run was only evidence about one side of it.
`services/config.js` records what was removed and why.

### Both halves in one command

`run-dev.ps1` at the repository root starts both in separate windows, waits for
`/api/actuator/health`, and opens the browser. It also clears any `DB_URL` / `FLYWAY_DB_URL` left in
the shell from a deploy session, which would otherwise point the local backend at a deployed database.

```powershell
.\run-dev.ps1                                       # backend 9090, UI 3322
.\run-dev.ps1 -BackendPort 8080 -FrontendPort 5173  # the historical defaults
```

`run-dev.cmd` is a double-clickable wrapper, since Windows opens `.ps1` files in an editor.

### Running on non-default ports

The UI port is free to change: the dev proxy rewrites `Origin` to its own target, so the browser's
port never reaches Spring and CORS does not arise. The backend port is not free — **`VITE_PROXY_TARGET`
must match it exactly**, or every `/api` call is connection-refused.

```powershell
$env:VITE_PROXY_TARGET = 'http://localhost:9090'
npm run dev -- --port 3322 --strictPort
```

`--strictPort` because a silently reassigned port is worse than a failure to start.

**Keep `VITE_API_BASE` as the relative `/api`.** The Vite dev proxy forwards it to
`localhost:8080` **without rewriting the path** — the backend genuinely serves under
`server.servlet.context-path=/api` — so requests stay same-origin and the dev and deployed URLs are
the same shape. An absolute cross-origin base reintroduces CORS *and* is blocked outright by the
page's `connect-src 'self'` CSP — which surfaces only as a generic "login failed".

> The proxy used to strip `/api` before forwarding, because the backend served `/auth/login`. That
> made the prefix a dev-only fiction that worked here and 404'd the moment `VITE_API_BASE` named a
> real host. Anything that calls the backend **directly** — `curl`, a REST client, a test helper —
> must therefore include `/api` itself: `http://localhost:8080/api/properties`. Swagger UI
> is at `/api/docs` and health at `/api/actuator/health`.

## 4. Verifying the integration

The automated coverage is `mvn verify` and the Playwright suite (§5). Two things neither covers —
verify them by hand against a live backend before trusting a release:

1. **Session survives a reload, and a 401 triggers one silent refresh rather than a logout.** Log in,
   hard-reload, then let the access token expire and make a request.
2. **Two tabs refreshing at once do not trip server-side reuse-detection.** Open the app in two tabs
   and reload both at the same moment; neither should be signed out.

This file used to document `_live_auth_probe.mjs` and `_crosstab_refresh_probe.mjs` for exactly these
two checks. Both files were zero bytes and had never contained anything — running them exited 0 and
verified nothing, which is worse than having no instruction at all. They were deleted and the checks
written out here instead (tech-debt D75).

> The same reasoning retired the `scripts/*-parity.mjs` harnesses. They drove the real http provider
> against the real dev backend, so they wrote to `draazy` and could not be pointed at a throwaway
> database without pointing the whole backend at one — and `review-parity.mjs` posted a **public**
> locality review on every run, four of which accumulated on `/locality/aundh` before the first
> live-reviews e2e began asserting against them as though they were seed data (tech-debt D100).
> A check that dirties the database it verifies is a check that has to be cleaned up after. The
> Playwright live lanes cover the same contracts and own their fixtures.

## 5. Tests

```powershell
cd backend; mvn verify        # requires draazy_test to exist and be free of demo data
cd e2e;     npx playwright test
```

## Known local gotchas

- **`target-cli`** — CLI Maven builds write there, not `target` (via `.mvn/maven.config`). `target`
  belongs to the VS Code Java language server; sharing one directory makes the two race and corrupt
  each other's output.
- **Postgres 13** is below Hibernate's minimum supported 14.0, so a version warning on boot is
  expected and harmless.
- **`usePolling` is on** in `vite.config.js` — OneDrive locks files mid-sync on Windows, which
  otherwise crashes Chokidar's native watcher with `EBUSY`.
- **A leftover refresh cookie from before the `__Host-` change signs you out forever.** Sign-in
  works, then every refresh 401s, then you are back at `/signin` — permanently, and a fresh sign-in
  does not fix it. The refresh cookie moved from `Path=/api/auth` to `Path=/` (see
  `docs/system/platform-architecture.md` §6.3). On the plain-http `local` and `e2e` profiles the
  cookie keeps its unprefixed name, so the old cookie and the new one have the *same name* at
  *different paths*, and a browser will not replace one with the other. Both are then sent to
  `/api/auth/refresh`, `RefreshCookie.presented()` correctly refuses to guess between two scopes,
  and the loop closes: the new cookie is written at `/` again, the stale one at `/api/auth` is never
  touched by anything. Production is immune — the rename to `__Host-draazy_rt` means the two
  cannot collide — so this is a local-only trap. Fix it once with "Clear site data" in DevTools
  → Application, or delete the `/api/auth`-scoped cookie by hand. The backend logs a `WARN` naming
  the cookie when it happens, so check the console before assuming the session is broken.
