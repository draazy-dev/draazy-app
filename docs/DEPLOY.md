# Deploying Draazy

The local counterpart is [`LOCAL_DEV.md`](./LOCAL_DEV.md). The *shape* of the deployment — Cloud Run
in `asia-south1`, Supabase Postgres in Mumbai, Cloudflare R2 — is decided in
[`system/platform-architecture.md`](./system/platform-architecture.md) §6 and ADR-007/ADR-013. This
file is the runbook: what to set, in what order, and which mistakes are silent.

> **Source of truth for the variable list is `ProdProfileContractTest`**, not this page. That test
> loads the real `application-prod.properties` and fails if a `${ENV}` lookup appears without being

## 1. The one rule that governs the whole topology

**The SPA and `/api` must be same-*site*.** The refresh token rides a `SameSite=Lax`, `__Host-`
prefixed cookie, so a browser only returns it when the page and the API share a registrable domain.
Two arrangements satisfy that:

| Shape | `WEB_ORIGINS` | `API_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` |
|---|---|---|
| **Path proxy** (chosen) — one origin, `/api/*` proxied to the backend | `https://sandbox.draazy.com` | `https://sandbox.draazy.com` |
| Sibling subdomains — cross-origin but same-site | `https://www.draazy.com` | `https://api.draazy.com` |

A UI served from its own registrable domain — `*.netlify.app`, `*.pages.dev`, `*.vercel.app`, all
Public Suffix List entries — is **fatal**, and fatal in the worst way: the browser withholds the
cookie *silently*, so every session dies fifteen minutes after login and the server log is
indistinguishable from a visitor who was never signed in. `CookieDeliveryCheck` refuses to boot on
that shape, which is the only reason it is caught at all — no test can reach it, because dev and e2e
go through the Vite proxy where everything is same-origin by construction.

Note that this rules out running the sandbox on its `*.pages.dev` preview URL. The custom domain has
to be attached before anyone can stay signed in.

The path proxy was chosen because it is the only one of the two that can also deliver the readable
`__Host-draazy_session` marker, without which the Safari/ITP session recovery is inert.

### How the proxy is implemented

`frontend/functions/api/[[path]].js` — a Cloudflare Pages Function, not a `_redirects` rule.
**Cloudflare Pages does not proxy `_redirects` to an external origin**; it redirects to it, which
lands the browser on the backend's origin and loses the cookie exactly as described above. Netlify
did proxy such a rule, which is why `scripts/gen-redirects.mjs` existed and why it was deleted
rather than carried over — kept, it would have produced a deploy that looked configured and was not.

Pages resolves Functions before static assets and before `_redirects`, so the SPA rewrites cannot
shadow `/api`. `_redirects` is generated at build time by `frontend/scripts/vite-plugin-spa-fallback.mjs`:
one rewrite per `App.jsx` route to the shell (prerendered pages rewrite to themselves first), which ships as `dist/404.html` so unknown paths answer a
real 404. A `/*` rewrite cannot be used: Pages ignores `/* /index.html`, and any other `/*` target
would be matched before the asset lookup and serve `/assets/*.js` as HTML. The `/api` prefix is forwarded verbatim because
the backend runs with `server.servlet.context-path=/api`. The Function's own configuration is a
single Pages environment variable, `API_ORIGIN` (scheme + host of the Cloud Run service, no path);
unset, it answers 502 rather than falling through — a fall-through would return the HTML shell with
a 200, which `http.js` reads as success and renders as an affirmative "no results" on every
catalogue.

Security headers and the CSP moved to `frontend/public/_headers`, values unchanged from the Netlify
config.

**Release note (L2):** the first deploy carrying the `__Host-` cookie names signs every
already-signed-in user out once. Nothing is lost; the next sign-in is normal.

---

## 2. Database — Supabase (ADR-007)

Supabase is used as **plain Postgres**. Its Auth, Realtime and Edge Functions are unused, we run our
own Flyway migrations and our own JWTs, and that is what keeps the lock-in low enough to leave.

You need **two** connection strings, and this is the part that costs a day if it is guessed:

| Variable | Supabase connection | Port | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | Supavisor pooler, **transaction** mode | `6543` | Cloud Run scales to zero and back; every cold start would otherwise open fresh backends against a free-tier connection ceiling measured in dozens |
| `FLYWAY_DB_URL` | Supavisor pooler, **session** mode | `5432` | Flyway locks concurrent deploys out with `pg_advisory_lock`, which is *session*-scoped. Transaction pooling moves the session between statements, so the lock is taken on one backend and released against another — Flyway's own docs call PgBouncer transaction mode unsupported |

Flyway and the running app log in as different roles. `FLYWAY_DB_USER` / `FLYWAY_DB_PASSWORD` are the
schema owner `postgres.<project-ref>`, and `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` are the DML-only runtime role
(§2.1). Only the migration job (§2.1) reads the Flyway pair. Spring Boot's dedicated Flyway DataSource
does not inherit credentials from `spring.datasource` when `spring.flyway.url` is set, which is why both
pairs are bound explicitly. If
you use the *direct* connection for migrations instead (username `postgres`, and IPv4 is a paid add-on
on new projects), point `FLYWAY_DB_URL` / `FLYWAY_DB_USER` at it.

Getting `FLYWAY_DB_URL` wrong does not fail cleanly. The migration hangs holding a lock nobody owns,
the job runs until its 15-minute timeout, and nothing in the log names Flyway.

Append `?sslmode=require` to both. `application-prod.properties` already pins
`prepareThreshold=0` (the transaction pooler cannot keep server-side prepared statements alive; the
symptom is an intermittent `prepared statement "S_1" does not exist` on the busiest endpoints only)
and a small, drainable HikariCP pool.

**The sandbox carries the demo seed, and it takes a named profile to get it.**
`spring.flyway.locations` is migration-only under `prod`, deliberately —
`R__zz_DML_dev_demo_data.sql` is *repeatable*, so it would re-seed 38 fabricated listings and 78
fabricated users on every deploy whose checksum moved, indistinguishable from real inventory to a
buyer. `application-sandbox.properties` is a standalone profile activated as
`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sandbox` — a self-contained copy of the prod configuration whose one
declared difference is that it adds the seed location back. A seeded database can never be promoted
to production: point production at its own Supabase project.

Sandbox and production read the same variable *names* and entirely different *values* — separate
Supabase projects, separate Secret Manager entries, separate Cashfree credentials.
`SandboxProfileContractTest` asserts the two files stay identical apart from the declared
divergence, so hardening prod without hardening sandbox fails the build.

All four tiers are in [`system/profiles.md`](./system/profiles.md).

### 2.1 Database roles, and the order to switch them

Supabase leaves two holes that the app never needs: the Data API serves `public` to `anon` and
`authenticated` with full grants, and `postgres` (the owner of every table) is a single credential for
both migrations and every request. Close them in this order, per project. Each step deploys green on
its own, so the rollout can stop at any point.

1. Run [`backend/deploy/sql/supabase-revoke-data-api.sql`](../backend/deploy/sql/supabase-revoke-data-api.sql)
   and switch the Data API off (Project Settings → Data API). Both verify queries must return no rows.
2. Copy today's values into the new Flyway inputs: `SANDBOX_FLYWAY_DB_USER` = the current
   `SANDBOX_DB_USER`, and secret `draazy-sandbox-flyway-db-password` = the current
   `draazy-sandbox-db-password`. Deploy. Nothing changes yet.
3. Run [`backend/deploy/sql/app-runtime-role.sql`](../backend/deploy/sql/app-runtime-role.sql), set
   the password with `\password draazy_app`, and check the verify output.
4. Point `SANDBOX_DB_USER` at `draazy_app.<project-ref>` and add the new password as a version of
   `draazy-sandbox-db-password`. Deploy. `DatabasePrivilegeCheck` refuses to boot if the runtime role can
   still run DDL.

Rollback for step 4: point `SANDBOX_DB_USER` back at `postgres.<project-ref>`, re-add the old password
version, and redeploy.

Migrations never run in the serving container. The deployed profiles set `spring.flyway.enabled=false`,
and `deploy.yml` first runs the Cloud Run Job
[`cloudrun-migrate-sandbox.yaml`](../backend/deploy/cloudrun-migrate-sandbox.yaml) to completion. The
job runs the same image with `--migrate-only`, which boots Flyway alone and exits. It runs as
`draazy-migrator-sandbox`, the only identity granted `draazy-sandbox-flyway-db-password`. The runtime
account gets per-secret grants that leave that secret out, so code execution in the app can no longer
reach the owner role. A failed job stops the deploy before the service is replaced. Migrations still
apply while the previous revision serves, so each one must stay compatible with the code before it.

Moving an existing project over takes two steps. The order matters, because any revision built before
this change still reads the Flyway password as the runtime account:

1. Re-run `bootstrap-project.sh`. It creates the migrator and grants every secret individually, then
   deploy.
2. Once a revision from this change is serving, drop the old project-wide grant:
   `gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT_ID" --member="serviceAccount:draazy-api-sandbox@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor --condition=None`.
   Rolling back past this change afterwards needs that grant restored first, or the old revision cannot
   start.

Run locally with `java -jar app.jar --migrate-only` and the three `FLYWAY_*` variables set.

---

## 3. Environment

Every variable below is declared with **no default**, so a deploy that omits one fails to start
rather than inheriting the developer values in `application.properties` (local Postgres credentials,
a committed JWT secret, `trusted-proxies=none`). That is the design, not an inconvenience.

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | transaction pooler, `:6543`, `sslmode=require` |
| `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` | runtime role `draazy_app.<project-ref>` (§2.1) |
| `FLYWAY_DB_USER` / `FLYWAY_DB_PASSWORD` | schema owner `postgres.<project-ref>`, migration job only; the service reads just the user name, for `DatabasePrivilegeCheck` |
| `FLYWAY_DB_URL` | session pooler, `:5432` — see §2 |
| `JWT_SECRET` | HS256, ≥ 32 bytes, generated per environment |
| `REFERRAL_SIGNAL_SALT` | any long random string; **never** shared with dev. Rotating it is safe — stored digests simply stop matching, and they are discarded after 180 days anyway |
| `IDENTITY_HASH_SECRET` | any long random string; **never** shared with dev. Keys the one-way digest of verified ID-document numbers used for "one document = one badge". Rotating it makes every existing badge's digest stop matching new submissions, so rotate only with a re-verification plan |
| `IDENTITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `IDENTITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` | base64 of 32 random bytes (`openssl rand -base64 32`) and a short id (`[a-z0-9-]`, e.g. `2026a`); **never** shared with dev. AES-256-GCM for PAN/Aadhaar in `service_request_identities` (D283). To rotate, issue a new key and id, and set `IDENTITY_RETIRED_KEYS=oldId:oldKey` so existing rows still decrypt. Losing a key makes its rows unreadable |
| `STAFF_TOTP_KEY` | base64 of 32 random bytes (`openssl rand -base64 32`); **never** shared with dev. AES-256-GCM for staff and admin authenticator (TOTP) secrets in `staff_credentials`. There is no retired-key list: rotating it makes every enrolled authenticator unreadable, so each account must be reset (admin **Reset 2FA**) and re-enrol |
| `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Cashfree signs callbacks with `x-client-secret` and issues no separate webhook secret, so this **is** `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`. `cloudrun-sandbox.yaml` therefore points both at one Secret Manager entry: two entries holding one credential drift the moment either is rotated alone, and a drifted-but-non-blank value passes every startup check and rejects every callback. A blank value makes every forged signature valid |
| `WEB_ORIGINS` | see §1 |
| `API_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | see §1 |
| `INTERNAL_PROXIES` | see §4 |
| `ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET` | see §4; ≥ 32 characters, and the **same** value as the Pages secret of that name. `none` turns the gate off, which is right only for an instance nothing proxies |

Optional first-admin bootstrap variables:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_MOBILE` | When no live admin exists, startup creates that admin and logs a one-hour `/staff-invite#...` link |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME` | Defaults to `Administrator` |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_RECOVER` | Break-glass nonce. Set a fresh random value and redeploy to reset the configured admin's 2FA, revoke sessions and log a fresh one-hour invite. If no admin holds the email, it adopts the live admin with the configured mobile and **no** email — how the seeded sandbox admin (`9000000000`) gets one |

The sandbox deploy reads them from the `sandbox` GitHub environment: **secrets**
`SANDBOX_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SANDBOX_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_MOBILE` (vars would print in the public
run log), and **variable** `SANDBOX_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_RECOVER`; blank = off. Set them there, not with
`gcloud run services update` — `services replace` wipes it.
`APP_BASE_URL` must be the SPA origin, or the logged link points at `draazy.com`.

First deploy:
1. Set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_MOBILE` and optionally `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME`.
2. Deploy, then open the `[ADMIN BOOTSTRAP]` link from the API logs within 1 hour and set the password.
3. Sign in at `/staff-login`, scan the QR code and save the recovery codes.

Break glass: set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_RECOVER` to a new random value and redeploy; open the new logged
link within 1 hour, then sign in and re-enrol the authenticator.

Staff/manager invites need no SMS or email sender. The Team screen returns the one-time link to the
creator, who shares it privately; manager-created staff invites also notify the administrator in-app.

`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` is baked into the image (`backend/Dockerfile`) rather than left to the
deploy, because Spring does not complain about an absent profile — a deploy that forgot it would
boot on the developer defaults and report itself healthy.

### 3.1 The sandbox login code — a stand-in for OTP delivery

Sandbox cannot send an OTP. WhatsApp is off while ADR-020 waits on Meta business verification, so
`SandboxOtpSender` accepts the send and drops it, and before this existed the shared environment
could not be signed into at all. `draazy.otp.sandbox-code` pins every code to one value so it can be
typed into the six-box OTP field like any other. It is **`000000`, hardcoded** in
`application-sandbox.properties` — the same code the e2e profile uses. Nothing to provision.

**Understand what this opens before you put anything real in that environment.** Any consumer
account in the sandbox can be signed into by anyone who knows its mobile. The back office is not
covered by it: staff and admin accounts sign in only with email, password and an authenticator code
(`POST /auth/staff-login`), and `/auth/login` refuses them even after a correct code. Use the
single-admin bootstrap below for the first back-office login.

That trade is acceptable for disposable demo inventory and is deliberate, not a gap to be reported.
It stops being acceptable the moment the sandbox database holds anything you would not publish; at
that point make the code a generated per-deploy secret in Secret Manager.

It is a key of its own rather than a reuse of `DRAAZY_OTP_FIXED_CODE` on purpose. That one is refused
on *every* deployment profile by `OtpService.rejectFixedCodeInProduction`, and sandbox counts as one,
so reusing it would have disarmed the guard that also covers prod.
`OtpService.rejectSandboxCodeOutsideSandbox` is the matching lock on the new key: the boot fails
unless `sandbox` is the *only* deployment profile active, so neither a copied properties file nor a
`prod,sandbox` activation can carry it into production. `application-prod.properties` also pins the
key empty, so a properties-only mistake never reaches that check.

One deploy consequence: the Dockerfile bakes in `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`, so a sandbox deploy
has to override it to `sandbox` — and to `sandbox` alone. Left at `prod`, or set to `prod,sandbox`,
the boot fails on this key, which is the intended way to discover the mistake.

Optional, all off by default in `application.properties`: `STORAGE_ENABLED` + `R2_*` (photo and
document upload — without them `R2FileStorage` is not wired and uploads throw), `CASHFREE_ENABLED` +
`CASHFREE_APP_ID` / `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` (payments and KYC), `CASHFREE_NOTIFY_URL` (blank falls back
to the endpoint registered in the Cashfree dashboard, which holds one address across every
environment — so each deployment sets its own), `APP_BASE_URL`, `RATELIMIT_STORE`. Sandbox turns the
first two families on in `cloudrun-sandbox.yaml`; "off by default" describes the base file, not that
deployment.

---

### 3.2 The public photo bucket must send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

A listing photo is not only rendered. The create-listing wizard draws each one to a `<canvas>` to
compute a perceptual hash, which the duplicate probe compares across owners, and reading pixels back
from a canvas that has drawn a cross-origin image throws unless that image arrived with CORS headers.

The failure is silent by construction: the client degrades to no hashes, the listing posts normally,
and the only symptom is that duplicate listings sharing photographs stop being flagged. Nothing in
the repository can assert it — the URL is R2's, the header is bucket configuration, and the dev
stand-in is same-origin (`DevObjectStore.publicUrl`), so no test will ever go red if the rule is
missing. It is written down because that is the only control available.

The same bucket should sit behind a **proxied custom domain**, not `r2.dev`, which Cloudflare does
not cache. On that domain the `.w480.jpg`/`.w960.jpg` card copies are edge-cached by default, but
originals have no file extension, so add one free Cache Rule (Caching → Cache Rules): hostname equals
the photo domain and URI path starts with `/photos/` → *Eligible for cache*, edge TTL *Use cache-control
header*. Every object already carries `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

### 3.3 Identity verification

Identity verification is a reviewed trust badge, not a synchronous unlock. Applicant endpoints live in
`backend/src/main/java/com/draazy/api/identity/verification/IdentityVerificationController.java`;
the browser flow is `frontend/src/pages/consumer/VerifyIdentity.jsx`.

| Area | Deployment requirement | Missing / wrong symptom |
|---|---|---|
| Camera | HTTPS origin; `Permissions-Policy: camera=(self)` in `frontend/public/_headers` | `getUserMedia` is absent or throws `NotAllowedError` / `SecurityError`; the screen shows the camera failure copy |
| iOS camera | `playsInline` on the `<video>` and camera start behind the user pressing the start button (`VerifyIdentityScreens.jsx`, `VerifyIdentity.jsx`) | Safari opens native fullscreen video or refuses playback/capture until another gesture |
| Face WASM | CSP `script-src 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in both `frontend/public/_headers` and `frontend/index.html` | MediaPipe WASM compile fails; the selfie step loses its liveness guidance |
| Self-hosted assets | `/models/*` immutable cache rule in `_headers` | First visit is slower; repeat visits may re-fetch the model instead of using the pinned copy |

**Face model supply chain.**

| Asset | Source in repo | Package / license |
|---|---|---|
| MediaPipe Face Landmarker | `frontend/src/lib/identity-verification/face.js` loads `/models/face_landmarker.task`; file at `frontend/public/models/face_landmarker.task` | `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` `1.0.1`, Apache-2.0 in `frontend/node_modules/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/package.json`; model card publishes Apache-2.0, verify against the model card at release |

Face checks run in the browser. Only the captured front/back/selfie images are uploaded,
to the private R2 bucket (`SANDBOX_R2_BUCKET_PRIVATE`, §5). The identity badge stores document
number HMACs and last-4 values only (`IdentityHasher.java`, `IdentityVerificationService.java`);
the raw document number is not stored by this badge flow.

Consent is stored with a notice version (`IdentityVerificationService.CONSENT_NOTICE_VERSION`,
currently `2026-09`) and the notice language (`en`, `hi`, `mr`). Treat this as DPDP Act 2023
notice/consent evidence, not a legal-compliance claim.

**Image retention and purge.**

| Case | Rule |
|---|---|
| Approved / rejected / revoked | Images purge after `draazy.identity.image-retention-days` from `decidedAt`; default `7` days |
| Pending too long | The `identity-pending-expiry` job (10:00 IST) rejects pending cases older than `draazy.identity.pending-ttl`; default `P14D`; it purges images immediately and sends the ordinary rejected decision |
| Resubmission / withdrawal / erasure | Existing identity files are queued and purged immediately in the transaction path |
| Storage delete failure | `identity_storage_deletes` keeps the key; the nightly `identity-delete-retry` job tries each due key once, up to 2,000 a night, least-tried first so a stuck key never blocks newer ones |

These are `JobRunner` jobs (§5) and inherit the Cloud Run CPU-throttling caveat there; an always-on
host (DigitalOcean, ADR-021) runs them as scheduled.

**WhatsApp identity decision template.**

The template sender is
`backend/src/main/java/com/draazy/api/provider/whatsapp/WhatsAppDecisionMessenger.java`; the property
binding is `WhatsAppProperties.java` and `application.properties` lines 111-124.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Meta category | `UTILITY` |
| Template body | One body component parameter: `{{1}}` text, carrying the full decision line |
| Suggested body text | `{{1}}` |
| Language | `WHATSAPP_IDENTITY_TEMPLATE_LANG`, default `en_US` |
| Template name | `WHATSAPP_IDENTITY_TEMPLATE_NAME`; blank means in-app only |
| Shared WhatsApp credentials | `WHATSAPP_ENABLED`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_BASE_URL`, `WHATSAPP_API_VERSION` |

Lines the backend sends:

| Decision | `{{1}}` value |
|---|---|
| Rejected by a reviewer / stale pending | `Your Draazy identity verification could not be completed. Open the app to see the reason and retake your photos.` |
| Revoked | `Your Draazy verified badge was withdrawn. Open the app to see the reason and submit again.` |

Approvals and the automatic check's rejects send no WhatsApp (in-app only). If `WHATSAPP_ENABLED=false`, `LoggingDecisionMessenger` logs a mock send. If WhatsApp is enabled but
the identity template name or language is blank, `WhatsAppDecisionMessenger` logs and skips only the
WhatsApp leg. Vendor failures are logged and swallowed; the decision is already committed and visible
in-app. Meta business verification and approved templates remain the gate before useful WhatsApp
delivery; see ADR-020 notes in §7.

**WhatsApp waiting-on-you digest template.** Sent by the `waiting-digest` job (10:00 IST, daily; it inherits the
Cloud Run CPU-throttling caveat in §5) through the same `WhatsAppDecisionMessenger`. Rules are in
[`notifications.md`](./system/notifications.md#waiting-on-you-digest--utility-template).

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Meta category | `UTILITY`; **needs Meta approval before the name is set** |
| Suggested body text | `You have {{1}} waiting for your reply on Draazy. Open the app to respond.` with `{{1}}` = `1 request` / `N requests` |
| Template name | `WHATSAPP_DIGEST_TEMPLATE_NAME`; blank means no digest is sent |
| Language | `WHATSAPP_DIGEST_TEMPLATE_LANG`, default `en_US` |
| Off switch | `draazy.jobs.waiting-digest.enabled=false` |

**Web push (VAPID).** `WebPushSender` is wired when `PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` is set; without it
`LoggingPushSender` only logs. Generate a pair once with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` (base64url).

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | Secret. Boot fails if it is set without the public key or is not a P-256 key |
| `PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | The matching public key |
| `PUSH_VAPID_SUBJECT` | Contact the push services may use; `mailto:` or https. Default `mailto:noreply@draazy.com` |
| `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | Frontend build-time variable carrying the **same public key**, so browsers subscribe to it |

On Cloud Run both keys are Secret Manager references (`draazy-sandbox-push-vapid-private-key` and
`draazy-sandbox-push-vapid-public-key` in `backend/deploy/cloudrun-sandbox.yaml`); create the secrets and grant the
runtime service account access before deploy, or the revision will not start. Rotating the pair invalidates every stored subscription: they are removed as the push
service answers 404/410 or they re-subscribe.

**Email (Zoho ZeptoMail via CPaaS).** Sender: `provider/zeptomail/ZeptoMailEmailSender.java`. Today it
only emails staff invite and password-reset links (`StaffInviteMailer`) to the account's own address;
the admin's copy-link dialog is unchanged and stays the fallback.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `ZEPTOMAIL_ENABLED` | `true` to send; off logs `[MOCK EMAIL]` with recipient domain + subject |
| `ZEPTOMAIL_API_KEY` | The agent's **Send Mail token** (CPaaS → Agents → agent → SMTP/API). Secret; with or without the `Zoho-enczapikey ` prefix |
| `ZEPTOMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | Default `noreply@draazy.com`; must be on a domain whose DKIM **and** CNAME show Verified |
| `ZEPTOMAIL_FROM_NAME` | Default `Draazy` |
| `ZEPTOMAIL_BASE_URL` | Default `https://cpaas.zoho.in` (India DC; the account lives on `cpaas.zoho.in`) |

Sandbox has it on in `cloudrun-sandbox.yaml`, reading the key from Secret Manager entry
`draazy-sandbox-zeptomail-api-key` with from-name `Draazy Sandbox`; the secret must exist before deploy.
The boot fails if the flag is on and the key or from-address is blank. Send failures log
`ZeptoMail send to ***@domain failed: <status> code=TM_xxxx SERR_xxx`; `SERR_157` is a bad token.

**Provider call log (`/admin/integrations`, admin only).** Every ZeptoMail, WhatsApp and Cashfree
call, and every Cashfree webhook, writes one `provider_call` row (`provider/ProviderCalls.java`):
outcome, masked recipient, order id or subject, an error code and the latency. Message bodies, OTPs,
links and keys are never stored. The page shows 24h/7d health per provider and a log searchable by
full email, mobile or order id. Rows are written off the request thread and purged after 30 days;
nothing to configure. Delivery and bounce receipts still live in each vendor's console.

**Server-chosen selfie pose.** `POST /me/verification/identity/challenge` issues a signed 15-minute
challenge with pose `left`, `right` or `smile` (`LivenessCheck.java`). If a challenge token is
submitted, the review queue exposes `livenessChallenge`, and `IdentityReviewService` refuses approval
until staff confirms the selfie shows that pose. The browser's local face verdict remains advisory.

Hardware checks live in
[`flows/consumer/contact-gate-leads.md`](./flows/consumer/contact-gate-leads.md#9-identity-verification-hardware-checklist).

**Post-deploy checks.**

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Submit one real identity verification using the R2 private bucket | `POST /me/verification/identity` returns `202`; review queue loads front/back/selfie images via signed URLs |
| Approve the case | User gains the verified badge; owner listings receive the verified owner stamp |
| Purge path | Files disappear under the retention rules above; failed deletes remain in `identity_storage_deletes` until retried |
| Reject the case (reviewer) | The decision message arrives with the exact line in the table above; an approval sends none |

## 4. `INTERNAL_PROXIES` and the origin gate

`WriteRateLimitFilter` keys anonymous callers on the client address, and `POST /page-views` is
`permitAll` and fires on ordinary browsing — so the 120-writes-per-60s budget is consumed by
*traffic*, not by attackers. Get this wrong in either direction and it is an outage:

- **Too narrow / `none`** behind a proxy: every visitor arrives as the proxy's address, the whole
  internet lands in one bucket, and the limiter becomes the outage it was added to prevent.
- **Too permissive**: the backend is still directly reachable at its own host, so anyone matching the
  regex picks their own bucket by sending an `X-Forwarded-For` of their choosing. An in-app limiter
  that can be spoofed is worse than none, because it reads as protection.

It must be a **Java regex** matching the actual egress of whatever sits in front of the app, or the
literal `none` for a directly-exposed instance. `TrustedProxyConfig` validates it at boot and names
the property when it is wrong.

On the chosen Cloudflare Pages → Cloud Run shape there are **two** hops. `frontend/functions/api/[[path]].js`
sets `X-Forwarded-For` from `CF-Connecting-IP`, overwriting anything the client sent and refusing to
forward at all if that header is absent; then Cloud Run's own front end appends the caller's address
before Tomcat sees the request. So the regex has to match Google's internal proxy range at minimum.

**And that is not yet enough, which is why this variable is still unset.** Adding Cloudflare's
egress ranges makes the value spoofable, because those addresses are **shared with every other
Cloudflare account**: anyone who learns the `*.run.app` URL can deploy their own free Worker,
`fetch` the origin directly with a forged `X-Forwarded-For`, and have `RemoteIpValve` pop the
Cloudflare hop and adopt the attacker's chosen address. That buys unlimited rotation of the
anonymous write budget, satisfies `BotDefenceFilter.verify` for arbitrary addresses, and — run the
other way — lets one address be pinned to a victim's IP to 429 them off the platform. Leaving
Cloudflare out instead collapses all anonymous traffic into the single Cloudflare-egress bucket.
Neither option is safe on its own.

The exit is to make the origin able to tell *this* proxy apart from any other Cloudflare tenant.
Three ways were weighed:

1. **Shared secret** — chosen (2026-09-27). Free, and it also makes a leaked Cloud Run URL stop
   mattering.
2. **Restricted ingress** — needs a Google external HTTPS load balancer in front of Cloud Run,
   roughly $18/month before Cloud Armor. Not free, so not for the sandbox.
3. **Cloudflare Authenticated Origin Pulls** (mTLS) — Cloud Run cannot verify a client certificate,
   so there is nothing at the origin to check it with.

### How the gate works

The Function sends `X-Proxy-Auth: <ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET>`, overwriting anything the client sent.
`OriginGateFilter` runs ahead of the JWT filter, the rate limiter and bot defence, and answers
**403** to any request whose header does not match (constant-time compare). The only exemptions are
`GET`/`HEAD` on the three health paths, `/api/actuator/health`, `/health/liveness` and
`/health/readiness`, because Cloud Run's probes and the backend job's smoke test reach the container
directly. Writes to those paths are gated too: they would otherwise reach the write rate limiter
without the secret, charged to whatever address the caller put in `X-Forwarded-For`.

Both halves must hold the same value:

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| Backend | Secret Manager entry `draazy-sandbox-origin-shared-secret`, mounted by `cloudrun-sandbox.yaml` |
| Pages Function | `npx wrangler pages secret put ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET --project-name=<project>` |

Generate it once, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48`. The backend refuses to boot on a blank value or on
one shorter than 32 characters; the Function answers 502 `api_proxy_misconfigured` when its copy is
unset. A **mismatch** fails differently: every `/api` call 403s while `/api/actuator/health` stays
green, so the frontend job's smoke test passes. Check a real route after changing either side.

**Rotation** has a short outage window: add the new Secret Manager version and Pages secret, then run
the deploy with `target: both`. Calls 403 between the backend going live and the Pages publish.

### `INTERNAL_PROXIES`, now that the gate is on

`none` is still the committed value, so all anonymous traffic still shares one bucket. With the gate
on, the chain Tomcat sees is `<client>, <Cloudflare egress>` from a Google front-end peer, and only
the Function can have written the left-most entry of any request that reaches an address-sensitive
filter (the ungated health reads are never counted). So a pattern matching every hop — `.*` —
resolves the real client and cannot be forged. **Never set it while `ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET` is `none`**: without
the gate that same value lets any caller choose their own address.

Set it **last**, after confirming the gate is live (a direct `curl` of the `*.run.app` URL for any
non-health route must answer 403) and checking the `X-Forwarded-For` a real proxied request produces.

### Free Cloudflare edge controls

These only protect traffic that goes through Cloudflare, which is why the gate had to come first. On
the `draazy.com` zone, free plan:

- **Managed WAF ruleset** (free tier) — on.
- **One rate-limiting rule** — e.g. `/api/auth/*` POST, per IP, to back up the OTP counters.
- **Custom WAF rules** (5 on the free plan) — e.g. block `/api/docs*` and `/api/swagger-ui*` on sandbox.
- **Turnstile** is already wired (`TurnstileBotDefence`).
- **Bot Fight Mode: leave off.** On the free plan it cannot be skipped per path, so it can challenge
  the Cashfree webhook at `/api/webhooks/cashfree/payment` and payments stop confirming without an error.

## 5. Google Cloud — one-time bootstrap

Run once per environment, by a human, from a machine with `gcloud` authenticated as a project owner.
Deliberately **not** scripted: half of it creates secrets whose values only you know, and a bootstrap
script that dies in the middle leaves a project in a state nobody can read.

The service definition itself is `backend/deploy/cloudrun-sandbox.yaml`, rendered through `envsubst`
by the backend job — the `${…}` tokens are the only per-environment inputs and everything else is a
deliberate literal, reviewable here rather than guessed at deploy time. `replace` makes that file the
whole truth: anything a console click added out of band is removed on the next deploy.

Six settings in it encode consequences that are invisible from the console:

| Setting | Value | Why not the default |
|---|---|---|
| `autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale` | `1` | The only setting here that costs money whether or not anyone uses the service: one instance held warm is ~₹1,300/month at `1Gi` (₹42/day on the Sep 2026 bill), billed at the *idle* rate because `cpu-throttling` stays on. Bought to remove the JVM boot plus Spring context refresh from the first request after an idle period, and from every redeploy cutover. The trap is reading it as "the backend is now running": CPU is still throttled to ~0 between requests, so the `@Scheduled` sweeps remain frozen. It satisfies one of ADR-011 Option C's two preconditions; the advisory-lock job runs (no ShedLock needed) and `cpu-throttling: 'false'` are the other half, and that half is the 6× bill. |
| `autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale` | `4` | Each instance opens up to 5 Postgres connections (`spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size`), so the ceiling multiplies straight into Supabase's budget: 4 × 5 = 20, which the free-tier pooler absorbs. At the default of 100 the same arithmetic gives 500 and the database refuses connections under a spike — arriving as scattered 500s on unrelated endpoints, never as anything naming the pool. It is also the runaway-cost stop: a crawler cannot cost more than four instances' compute. |
| `containerConcurrency` | `40` | Tomcat accepts 200 by default and then parks 195 of them on Hikari until its 30-second connection timeout expires, which surfaces as slow 500s rather than honest backpressure. Forty keeps the queue short enough that Cloud Run scales out instead. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | `3600` | The Cloud Run maximum. The messages SSE stream (`MessageEventHub`) is a single long request, so any shorter timeout cuts it mid-stream and reconnects every client on that period (it did at `120`); the hub's own 5-minute stream timeout and 25-second heartbeat bound it instead. The other slow request is a 13 MB multipart upload (`spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size`) over a slow mobile uplink. A hung ordinary request now holds its thread for longer than the old `120`. |
| `resources.limits.memory` | `1Gi` | The Dockerfile sets `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=70.0`, so this is a ~717 Mi heap with ~300 Mi for metaspace, code cache and thread stacks. Measured under these limits: 40 concurrent requests peak at ~650 MB resident, and the live heap after GC is ~130 MB. The migration job uses the same size; applying every migration plus the seed peaked at ~560 MB. At 512 Mi the non-heap no longer fits and the container is OOM-killed during startup. With `minScale: 1` each extra GiB is billed around the clock. |
| `startupProbe` | HTTP, `60 × 5s` | A TCP probe passes the moment Tomcat binds, so Cloud Run would route traffic to a context that is not finished refreshing. The path carries `/api` because `server.servlet.context-path` moves the actuator too. Migrations run in the job before this revision starts (§2.1), so the 300 seconds of grace now only covers a cold JVM on a throttled CPU. A warm deploy is ready in about 45 s. `livenessProbe` watches the `liveness` group, which deliberately excludes the database indicator: restarting the container is no part of the remedy for Supabase being down. |

`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sandbox` is set on the service, overriding the `prod` baked into the image.
`application-sandbox.properties` is standalone rather than a delta — its own datasource, secrets,
cookie flags, OTP throttle and proxy CIDR — and `SandboxProfileContractTest` asserts it agrees with
prod on every security-critical key. `WEB_ORIGINS` and `API_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` are public literals;
`CookieDeliveryCheck` refuses to boot if they describe a cross-site shape. `DB_URL`, `FLYWAY_DB_URL`
and `DB_USER` are rendered from repository secrets because the repository is public and they name the
Supabase project — that is about not committing them, not about confidentiality afterwards: as
plaintext env values they are readable by any project viewer and recorded in the Admin Activity audit
log for 400 days.

Secrets use `key: latest` rather than a pinned version, so a rotation reaches the next revision
without editing the file — and so a bad rotation reaches it the same way. The consequence worth
knowing: the SHA-tagged image makes *redeploy a known tag* a complete rollback for **code** and not
for **secrets**. Yesterday's image still picks up today's `latest` `JWT_SECRET`, which invalidates
every issued token. The two Cashfree secrets are referenced unconditionally and must **exist** before
the first deploy — a `secretKeyRef` to a missing secret is a hard error, not an empty string. Sandbox
now runs with `CASHFREE_ENABLED=true`, so they must hold the real `TEST_` / `cfsk_` values rather than
a placeholder: a placeholder is non-blank, so the service boots normally and every order creation 401s.
There is deliberately no `cashfree-webhook-secret` entry — see the table in §3.1.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=draazy-sandbox          # your project
REGION=asia-south1                 # Mumbai, co-located with Supabase (ADR-007). NOT CHANGEABLE LATER.
SERVICE=draazy-api-sandbox

gcloud config set project "$PROJECT_ID"
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com

# Image registry, in the same region as the service. A cross-region pull adds latency to the cold
# start, which is already the slowest request the platform serves.
gcloud artifacts repositories create draazy --repository-format=docker --location="$REGION"

# Runtime identity. One role. Cloud Run's default is the Compute Engine service account, which
# carries project Editor — a container compromise there is a compromise of the whole project.
gcloud iam service-accounts create "$SERVICE" --display-name="Draazy API (sandbox) runtime"
RUNTIME="$SERVICE@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Every secret `cloudrun-sandbox.yaml` names with a secretKeyRef. Miss one and `services replace`
# is a hard boot error, so create them all even where the feature behind them is off — an unused
# placeholder version costs nothing. Ten is past Secret Manager's free six; the overage is cents.
for s in db-password jwt-secret referral-signal-salt identity-hash-secret staff-totp-key \
         cashfree-app-id cashfree-secret-key \
         r2-access-key-id r2-secret-access-key origin-shared-secret; do
  gcloud secrets create "draazy-sandbox-$s" --replication-policy=automatic
  gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding "draazy-sandbox-$s" \
    --member="serviceAccount:$RUNTIME" --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
done

# The schema-owner password goes to the migration job's identity only, never the runtime (§2.1).
gcloud iam service-accounts create draazy-migrator-sandbox --display-name="Draazy schema migrations"
gcloud secrets create draazy-sandbox-flyway-db-password --replication-policy=automatic
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding draazy-sandbox-flyway-db-password \
  --member="serviceAccount:draazy-migrator-sandbox@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
```

Then add each value — **piped, never as an argument**, because a command line lands in shell history
and in the process table:

```bash
printf '%s' "$THE_VALUE" | gcloud secrets versions add draazy-sandbox-jwt-secret --data-file=-
```

`JWT_SECRET` is HS256 and must be at least 32 bytes, generated per environment —
`openssl rand -base64 48`. `REFERRAL_SIGNAL_SALT` is any long random string and must never be the dev
one. An unsalted or publicly-salted digest of an IPv4 address is reversed by enumerating 2^32 values,
which turns a fraud signal into a stored address — so prod carries no default, though the base file
does for local runs. `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` needs no entry of its own: it reads
`draazy-sandbox-cashfree-secret-key`, because that is the key Cashfree signs callbacks with. Note
what that means for the blast radius — that one entry now carries order-creation and refund
authority as well as signing, so grant it accordingly. `IDENTITY_HASH_SECRET` is the one secret
here that is **set-once rather than rotatable**: it keys the digest that makes one document grant one
badge, so a new value silently turns every existing holder into a stranger the uniqueness check has
never seen.

### The deploy identity

The backend job in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` authenticates by **Workload Identity Federation**,
so no GCP credential is stored anywhere in the repository: GitHub mints a short-lived OIDC token and
GCP exchanges it for an access token that expires in about an hour. §5.1 below defines the trust, and
the whole of it rests on the provider's attribute condition — a pool created without one mints tokens
for any repository on earth that knows the provider's resource name, and that name is public.

The deployer service account therefore has **no key to rotate**. If one was ever created, delete it
(`gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account="$DEPLOYER"`) and delete the `GCP_SA_KEY`
secret with it; a key that still exists is a permanent credential regardless of whether the workflow
uses it. Keep its roles to these three.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create github-deployer --display-name="GitHub Actions deployer"
DEPLOYER="github-deployer@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Scoped to the runtime service account, NOT the project. This is the grant that decides whether a
# leaked deploy key is a deploy-path compromise or a project takeover: at project level,
# serviceAccountUser confers actAs on EVERY service account in the project, including the default
# Compute Engine one — which carries Editor. The holder would deploy a container running as it and
# own the project, defeating the whole point of giving the runtime identity a single role.
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$RUNTIME" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$DEPLOYER" --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser

# Scoped to the one repository. The deployer pushes images; it has no business reading or deleting
# any other repository the project acquires later.
gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding draazy --location="$REGION" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$DEPLOYER" --role=roles/artifactregistry.writer

# The one grant that stays project-wide, and knowingly. Cloud Run IAM cannot be scoped to a service
# that does not exist yet, and this role creates it. `run.admin` rather than `run.developer` because
# the workflow's "Allow public invocation" step calls setIamPolicy, which developer lacks.
#
# THE COST: on this project the deploy key can describe every Cloud Run service and read its
# plaintext environment. Tighten it after the first successful deploy by swapping the binding for a
# service-scoped one — `gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding "$SERVICE" --region "$REGION"
# --member="serviceAccount:$DEPLOYER" --role=roles/run.admin` — and removing the project binding.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$DEPLOYER" --role=roles/run.admin

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account="$DEPLOYER"
```

The deployer needs **no** Secret Manager role. Cloud Run checks the *runtime* identity's
`secretAccessor` grant when it starts the container, not the caller's when it deploys.

Paste `key.json` into the GitHub **environment** `sandbox` as `GCP_SA_KEY`, then **delete the local
file** — `shred -u key.json`. Also on that environment:

| Kind | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| variable | `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | the project id |
| secret | `SANDBOX_DB_URL` | transaction pooler, `:6543` (§2) |
| secret | `SANDBOX_FLYWAY_DB_URL` | session pooler, `:5432` (§2) |
| secret | `SANDBOX_DB_USER` | `draazy_app.<project-ref>` (§2.1) |
| secret | `SANDBOX_FLYWAY_DB_USER` | `postgres.<project-ref>` |
| variable | `SANDBOX_R2_ENDPOINT` | `https://<accountId>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| variable | `SANDBOX_R2_BUCKET_PRIVATE` | bucket for identity captures, never public |
| variable | `SANDBOX_R2_BUCKET_PUBLIC` | bucket for listing photos |
| variable | `SANDBOX_R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | public read origin for the public bucket |

The four R2 entries are variables, not secrets: they are identifiers, and the key pair that actually
opens the bucket lives in Secret Manager. With `STORAGE_ENABLED=true` the workflow requires all four
to be non-blank, because a blank one reaches the container empty and `R2FileStorage`'s all-six
constructor check refuses to boot — a crash loop rather than a bad upload. Leaving one out of the
`envsubst` list would be worse: the literal `${R2_ENDPOINT}` is non-blank, so that check would pass
and the loud refusal would become a quiet failure on the first upload.

The connection strings are repository secrets rather than variables for one reason only: **this
repository is public, and they name the Supabase project.** That is about not committing them, not
about confidentiality after deploy — they reach Cloud Run as plaintext environment values, readable
by any project viewer and recorded verbatim in the Admin Activity audit log for 400 days. Treat the
project ref as known to anyone with access to the GCP project; the password, which is the thing that
matters, never leaves Secret Manager.

**Decide the deployment branch policy on the `sandbox` and `sandbox-web` environments.**
`workflow_dispatch` accepts any ref, and the workflow's confirmation input checks the environment
name rather than `github.ref` — so under "All branches", anyone with write access can deploy an
unreviewed branch, including one that edits `cloudrun-sandbox.yaml` to name a different runtime
service account, or one that edits `frontend-publish` to exfiltrate the Cloudflare token. Restricting
the policy to `main` closes that and costs the ability to deploy a feature branch — which is the
reason the trigger is manual in the first place. Sandbox keeps "All branches" deliberately; a
production environment must not. Either way the environment setting is the right place for the
decision, because it cannot be changed by the same pull request that would abuse it.

**If the organisation enforces `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`**, the workflow's
"Allow public invocation" step fails: `allUsers` cannot be granted. Either exempt the project from
the policy or accept that Cloudflare must authenticate to the origin, which is remediation 2 in §4
arriving early — in which case §4 stops being deferred and the Pages Function needs to mint an
identity token.

### 5.1 Workload Identity Federation, and the gates in front of it

`bootstrap-project.sh` wires the deploy identity with Workload Identity Federation instead of the
JSON key above: GitHub mints a short-lived OIDC token for the deploy job and GCP exchanges it for an
access token valid about an hour, so the repository stores no permanent credential. `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER`
and `GCP_DEPLOYER_SA` are environment **variables**, not secrets — a provider resource name and a
service-account email are identifiers, and holding them as secrets would imply the exchange is gated
on knowing them.

**The provider's attribute condition is the whole security boundary.** The provider resource name is
printed in a public workflow file. Without a condition, any repository on GitHub that reads it can
mint a token against the pool. `bootstrap-project.sh` pins two claims:

- `assertion.repository == 'owner/repo'` — checked against a claim the subject template cannot rewrite.
- `assertion.sub == 'repo:OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID:environment:sandbox'` — narrows the grant from
  the repository to **one job in it**. `assertion.repository` alone is satisfied by any workflow here
  holding `id-token: write`, including one added later by a pull request. GitHub only puts
  `environment` in the subject for a job that declares one, so requiring it makes `environment:
  sandbox` load-bearing for credential *issuance* rather than bookkeeping — and puts that
  environment's reviewer and branch policies genuinely in front of GCP.

Two ways to get that string wrong, both of which fail every deploy with a permission error that names
neither cause:

- **The environment name is compared as a string, including case.** Creating it in the UI as
  "Sandbox", or renaming `jobs.deploy.environment` in the workflow alone, breaks the exchange. Change
  both sides together and re-run the bootstrap script, which re-applies the trust.
- **The subject carries numeric IDs.** Repositories created after 2026-07-15 use GitHub's immutable
  subject format (`repo:OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID:...`); this one was created 2026-07-25. The
  `repo:OWNER/REPO:...` shape most tutorials show matches nothing here. The IDs are the point: they
  survive a rename or a transfer. Verify with `github/actions-oidc-debugger` if a deploy fails on it.

The service-account binding uses `principal://...subject/`, not
`principalSet://...attribute.repository/`, so both halves agree on the same scope — binding on the
repository attribute would grant deploy rights to every job in the repo and leave the provider
condition as the only thing refusing them.

**The deploy is manual, and that moves the second boundary.** `deploy.yml` has no push trigger and
no `workflow_run` trigger: nothing reaches Cloud Run or Cloudflare until someone opens Actions →
Deploy (sandbox) → Run workflow, picks a ref, and types `sandbox`. That removes the `workflow_run`
fork-pull-request problem outright — `workflow_run` hands the triggered workflow secrets and a write
token even when the triggering run had neither, and `branches: [main]` never guarded it because a
fork can name a branch `main` ("Preventing pwn requests", GitHub Security Lab). With the trigger
gone, no event an outsider can cause starts a job holding these credentials.

It also removes every automatic gate. **The workflow ships the ref you point it at and does not read
its CI result**, because a feature branch has no CI run to read — `ci.yml` runs on `push` to `main`
and on `pull_request`, so a branch pushed without a PR has none at all. Nothing checks that the
commit is the head of anything, either: dispatching an old ref will roll Cloud Run and its migrations
backwards without a warning. Read the checks on the commit before dispatching; the confirmation input
and the environment branch policy are the only things between the form and a live
`gcloud run services replace`.

### 5.2 Moving to a new GCP project or account

Project ids are globally unique and never reused, so a move is a new project, not a rename. Supabase,
R2 and Cloudflare are separate vendors and stay as they are; only the GCP half is rebuilt.

```bash
gcloud auth login                     # once per account; keep the old one logged in too
PROJECT_ID=<new-id> OLD_PROJECT_ID=<old-id> OLD_ACCOUNT=<old-email> bash backend/deploy/bootstrap-project.sh
```

`OLD_PROJECT_ID` copies every secret instead of prompting. **That is mandatory while the database is
kept**: `identity-hash-secret`, `identity-encryption-key` and `staff-totp-key` are set-once, and fresh
values orphan every stored hash, make stored PAN/Aadhaar unreadable and force all staff to re-enrol 2FA.
API keys created *in* the old project (`google-places-server-key`, the browser Maps key and Map ID)
die with it — recreate them in the new project and add a new secret version before deleting the old one.

Then set the three variables the script prints on the `sandbox` environment, dispatch the backend
deploy, point Pages `API_ORIGIN` at the new `*.run.app` URL, and only then delete the old project —
`minScale: 1` keeps billing it until you do.

### Scheduled jobs

`com.draazy.api.jobs.JobRunner` runs every background job in four cron groups, all in IST. Each job
runs in its own try, so one failure is logged and the rest of the group carries on; the group's
advisory lock (`JobRunScheduler`) keeps it on one instance.

| Group | Cron property (default) | Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| Frequent | `draazy.jobs.frequent.cron` (`0 */15 * * * *`) | `abandoned-checkouts`, `pass-refunds`, `listing-duplicates` |
| Hourly | `draazy.jobs.hourly.cron` (`0 5 * * * *`) | `subscription-expiry`, `saved-search-counts`, `page-view-rollup`, `flatmate-post-expiry` (public reads don't check `active_until`, so a lapsed post shows until it runs) |
| Nightly, 00:00 | `draazy.jobs.nightly.cron` (`0 0 0 * * *`) | silent cleanup: `refresh-tokens`, `referral-signal-retention`, `co-fill-invite-retention`, `service-request-identity-retention`, `notification-retention`, `page-view-retention`, `error-event-retention`, `audit-log-retention`, `provider-call-retention`, `identity-image-purge`, `identity-delete-retry`, `identity-conflict-retention` |
| Daytime, 10:00 | `draazy.jobs.daytime.cron` (`0 0 10 * * *`) | anything that messages a user: `identity-pending-expiry`, `contact-returns`, `referral-holds`, `needs-info`, `flatmate-owner-tier`, `flatmate-agreement-expiry`, `flatmate-draazy-agreements`, `flatmate-post-reminders`, `renewal-reminders`, `waiting-digest` |

Switches: `draazy.jobs.enabled=false` turns off all of them (the test suite does), and
`draazy.jobs.<name>.enabled=false` (env `DRAAZY_JOBS_<NAME>_ENABLED`) turns off one. Daily jobs that
read a capped page (200–500 rows) repeat until a page comes back empty, up to ten pages a run.

`spring.task.scheduling.pool.size=2` is a connection budget, not a throughput setting. A group run holds
one connection for its lock transaction and the work checks out a second. With
`spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=5`, two concurrent runs take four and leave one for HTTP. More
threads let a long nightly run overlap the 15-minute and hourly ticks and starve requests. Raise both
together. A run that finds both threads busy starts late; it isn't skipped.

**On Cloud Run they do nothing.** CPU is allocated only while a request is in flight, so the
scheduler thread is frozen between requests and no cron fires. Nothing logs the non-execution. On
the sandbox this is accepted; production runs on an always-on host (ADR-021).

## 6. Order of operations

1. **Container builds and boots.** `docker build -t draazy-api backend/` then run it against the
   Supabase sandbox project with the §3 variables and `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sandbox`.
   Success is `GET /api/actuator/health` returning `UP` — note the `/api` prefix,
   `server.servlet.context-path=/api` moves the probes too. Migrations having run is implied:
   `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate` means a boot that completes has proved the entities
   still match the schema.
2. **Cloudflare Pages**, building `frontend/` (`npm run build`, output `dist`), with `API_ORIGIN`
   set to the Cloud Run URL. Attach `sandbox.draazy.com` — the `*.pages.dev` URL cannot be used for
   anything requiring a session (§1). Then the only verification that exists for the cookie
   topology: sign in, wait past the 15-minute access-token expiry, make one authenticated request.
   If it survives, the refresh cookie is being delivered *and* the edge forwards `Cookie` to the
   proxy target. Playwright structurally cannot cover this.

   **Then disconnect the git integration** (Pages → Settings → Builds & deployments). From step 4
   the frontend is published by direct upload from CI, and that deploy is manual — so an integration
   left connected is the only thing still building on a push, and it will quietly replace whatever
   you deployed on purpose with the head of whatever branch was pushed. If the project refuses to
   disconnect, create a Direct Upload project and move the custom domain to it.

   `API_ORIGIN` stays configured **on the project**, not in the workflow. Direct uploads do not
   touch project environment variables, so it survives every deploy — and it names the Cloud Run
   service, which is infrastructure rather than build input. `ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET` (§4) lives
   there too, as a secret.
3. **R2 keys**, then one photo upload end-to-end. R2 is cross-origin from the SPA and must supply
   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` itself, or browser-side perceptual hashing fails on the canvas read.
4. **Deploy pipeline.** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — **manual only.** Actions → Deploy (sandbox)
   → Run workflow, pick any branch or tag in "Use workflow from", type `sandbox`, choose `both` /
   `backend` / `frontend`. Nothing deploys on a push. It requires the §5 bootstrap to exist first.

   It ships **both halves from one commit, backend first**. The backend job builds the image,
   pushes it to Artifact Registry tagged with the commit SHA, and applies the service definition
   with `gcloud run services replace` rather than `deploy`: `replace` makes the file the whole
   truth, so a setting deleted from the repo is deleted from the service instead of lingering
   forever. `frontend-build` then builds `frontend/` and `frontend-publish` ships it with
   `wrangler pages deploy`, tagged with the same SHA so both dashboards name one commit.

   The order is not arbitrary. API changes here are additive (expand/contract), which makes the
   asymmetry total: an old UI always works against a new backend, and a new UI does not work
   against an old one. The frontend will not start until the backend's smoke test is green.

   Nothing is gated on CI, because the ref you pick need not have one — see §5.1. The `target`
   input is the whole decision: there is no path diff and no test-result lookup.

   **The frontend is two jobs, and the split is a security boundary.** `frontend-build` runs
   `npm ci` and `npm run build` — which execute dependency and project scripts — and holds no
   deploy credential and declares no environment. It hands `dist/` and `functions/` to
   `frontend-publish` as an artifact; that job checks out nothing, so `npx wrangler` cannot be
   redirected by an `.npmrc` or a shadowing `node_modules/wrangler` planted during the build. It
   uses a **separate environment, `sandbox-web`**, holding only the Cloudflare credentials: GitHub
   writes the environment name into the OIDC subject and the GCP provider is pinned to
   `:environment:sandbox`, so the publish job cannot mint Cloud Run credentials even if it is later
   granted `id-token: write`.

   **Two build-time hazards live in the frontend half.** Every `VITE_*` value is inlined by Vite at
   build time and every read in `src/` has a fallback, so a missing one produces a bundle that
   boots and is quietly broken in one feature; the build fails closed on `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   for that reason. And `wrangler pages deploy` finds `functions/` by convention relative to the
   working directory, so it must run from a directory where `functions/` sits beside `dist/` —
   run anywhere else it uploads the static assets alone, succeeds, and ships a site whose `/api`
   calls fall through to the SPA rule and return `index.html` with a **200**, which `http.js` reads
   as a successful empty response. The final smoke test asserts the *content type* of
   `/api/actuator/health` through `sandbox.draazy.com` precisely because the status code cannot
   tell those apart.

## 7. Known blockers

- **Nobody can log in on `prod` until WhatsApp is configured.** `UnconfiguredOtpSender` — selected on
  every profile except `local` and `sandbox` while `draazy.providers.whatsapp.enabled` is false —
  throws on every send. (`sandbox` is the exception: it uses a hardcoded login code, §3.1.) Set
  the flag plus the `WHATSAPP_*` credentials (ADR-020: `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`,
  `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_OTP_TEMPLATE_NAME`, `WHATSAPP_OTP_TEMPLATE_LANG`) before the
  first useful deploy. The token must be a **System User** token; the one the App Dashboard offers
  expires in 24 hours. **Before turning the flag on, add a spend cap on the Meta billing account**:
  `OtpService` throttles per *recipient*, so walking thousands of valid-looking numbers gets a fresh
  budget for each one. On WhatsApp that is worse than a bill — sends to non-WhatsApp numbers drag
  the sending number's quality rating down, which cuts the daily messaging limit and takes sign-in
  itself offline days later.
- **Scheduled jobs do not run on Cloud Run.** CPU throttling freezes the scheduler thread between
  requests — see §5. Accepted on the sandbox; production needs an always-on host (ADR-021). Each run
  takes a Postgres advisory lock per job, so more than one instance is safe and no ShedLock is needed.
- **Backups.** Supabase's free tier has limited backups and no PITR. A scheduled logical dump to R2
  is the stopgap until Pro is justified.
- **The anonymous rate limiter is bypassable until §4 is decided.** Not a boot failure and not
  visible in any log — it simply does not do what it looks like it does.
- **Postgres TLS is `require`, not `verify-full`.** `application-prod.properties` pins `sslmode` so
  pgjdbc's default `prefer` cannot silently fall back to plaintext on the Cloud Run → Supabase hop,
  but `require` does not authenticate the server, so an active MITM is still possible. Raising it
  means baking the Supabase CA into the image and adding `sslrootcert`; `FLYWAY_DB_URL` needs the
  same, in the URL itself, because Flyway builds its own DataSource and the Hikari property does not
  reach it.

## 8. Logs, errors and alerts on DigitalOcean — $0

Nothing here costs money; non-critical logs are not worth paying to keep.

| Signal | Where it lives | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime logs (ECS JSON on stdout, every line carries `traceId`) | App Platform → Runtime Logs, `doctl apps logs <app> --type run --follow` | live only — DO keeps none |
| Build / deploy logs | App Platform → Activity | 90 days (DO) |
| Every backend `ERROR` and every sandbox/prod UI crash, deduplicated, PII-scrubbed | `error_event` → Admin ▸ Error log | 30 days after first seen |
| Outbound provider calls (ZeptoMail, WhatsApp, Cashfree), with `trace_id` | `provider_call` → Admin ▸ Settings call log | 30 days |
| Critical/high privileged actions | `audit_log` → Admin ▸ Audit trail | 365 days (CERT-In 180 d, DPDP Rule 6 one year) |

**Finding a bug.** A user quotes the reference on the error screen, or an API error body carries
`traceId`. Search it in Admin ▸ Error log; the same id is on the runtime-log lines and on
`provider_call.trace_id`. Scheduled-job errors carry `job-<Class.method>-<id>`.

**Do not enable log forwarding.** OpenSearch and Datadog are paid; Better Stack's free plan keeps
3 days, which adds nothing the error table does not already hold for 30.

**Free alert policies** — add to the app spec (`alerts` at app level, the rest under the service):

```yaml
alerts:
  - rule: DEPLOYMENT_FAILED
  - rule: DOMAIN_FAILED
services:
  - name: api
    alerts:
      - { rule: RESTART_COUNT, operator: GREATER_THAN, value: 2, window: TEN_MINUTES }
      - { rule: MEM_UTILIZATION, operator: GREATER_THAN, value: 85, window: FIVE_MINUTES }
      - { rule: CPU_UTILIZATION, operator: GREATER_THAN, value: 85, window: TEN_MINUTES }
    health_check:
      http_path: /api/actuator/health/liveness
```

**One free Uptime check** (DO credits one per month): HTTPS `GET https://draazy.com/api/actuator/health`,
alerts on downtime and SSL expiry to the owner's email. A second check is $1/month — not needed.

**Scaling out is safe for the jobs.** Every cron-scheduled run takes a Postgres advisory lock keyed
on the job name and skips if another instance holds it, so two instances never run the same job group.
