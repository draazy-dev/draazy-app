# Draazy — Documentation

Written documentation for Draazy (Pune-first real-estate marketplace).

These docs were originally the **API-build reference**: the React app held the business logic in a
mock service layer, and the docs captured it so it could be re-implemented server-side. **That
purpose is discharged** — the backend exists and the mock layer is gone. So the rule changed:

> **If a machine already enforces a fact, the docs do not restate it.** They carry the *reasoning*,
> which no test can hold.

## Who owns which fact

| Fact | Source of truth | What keeps it honest |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint paths, params, status codes, schemas | [OpenAPI spec](../backend/src/main/resources/static/openapi/draazy-api.yaml) (Swagger UI at `/docs`) | `SpecCoverageTest` — fails the build on served-but-undeclared **and** declared-but-unhandled |
| Physical database schema | `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/**` | Flyway `validate` on every boot |
| Test coverage | [`../e2e/COVERAGE.md`](../e2e/COVERAGE.md) | `check-coverage-citations.mjs` |
| **Business rules, and why** | **`flows/` §1–§8** | nothing — this is why it is written down |

## Reading order

1. [`system/platform-architecture.md`](./system/platform-architecture.md) — components, ADRs, vendor decisions, deployment shape, SLOs (living doc).
2. [`system/package-structure.md`](./system/package-structure.md) — the 11 bounded contexts → packages → Flyway groups, enforced by `ArchitectureBoundaryTest`.
3. [`system/data-model.md`](./system/data-model.md) — ER map and persistence design. Field shapes live in the OpenAPI schemas; the migrations are the physical schema.
4. [`system/cross-cutting.md`](./system/cross-cutting.md) — auth/roles, contact gate, **maker-checker**, soft-delete/audit, pagination, provider seams, error shape.
5. [`system/api-standards.md`](./system/api-standards.md) — the conventions the spec is written to.
6. [`flows/`](./flows/) — per-feature deep dives: business logic, state machines, edge cases.
7. [`system/frontend-data-seam.md`](./system/frontend-data-seam.md) — the `services/*` seam, the wire contracts its mappers hold, and the rule that pages never import `lib/` directly.
8. [`system/design-system.md`](./system/design-system.md) — control sizing scale, the mobile-first system, the design-validation checklist.
9. [`system/platform-architecture.md`](./system/platform-architecture.md) — §6.4 + ADR-019: badge-not-gate, and why freshness beats identity.
10. [`system/code-quality.md`](./system/code-quality.md) — the ponytail ladder, comment hygiene, and how static-analysis findings get triaged.
11. [`system/tech-debt.md`](./system/tech-debt.md) — the debt register: everything knowingly deferred, with the trigger that unblocks it. Finished items are **deleted**, not archived.
12. [`system/open-questions.md`](./system/open-questions.md) — decisions the build is waiting on. Separate from the register so the register stays 100% actionable.
13. [`system/legal-entity-and-compliance.md`](./system/legal-entity-and-compliance.md) — entity choice, registration roadmap, MahaRERA/DPDP (launch-gate advisory).

## Running it

Operational, not part of the reading order above — reach for these when you are at a terminal.

- [`system/profiles.md`](./system/profiles.md) — the four tiers (`local` → `local,e2e` → `sandbox` → `prod`), what each turns on, and how the deployed ones are kept from drifting apart.
- [`system/notifications.md`](./system/notifications.md) — every in-app, WhatsApp, email and push message we send (consumer and back office), with its copy, cost and trigger.
- [`LOCAL_DEV.md`](./LOCAL_DEV.md) — both halves on one machine.
- [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) — the deploy **contract**: the same-site cookie rule, every environment variable, and which mistakes fail silently. Read it to understand a value.
- [`MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`](./MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md) — what to check by hand in sandbox (full regression) and production (smoke) after a deploy, and the production never-do list.
- [`DEPLOY_WALKTHROUGH.md`](./DEPLOY_WALKTHROUGH.md) — the **sequence**: Supabase → container → GCP → GitHub → Cloud Run → Cloudflare Pages → `sandbox.draazy.com`, in order, for macOS and Windows. Read it to perform a deploy. Where the two disagree on a value, `DEPLOY.md` wins; where they disagree on order, the walkthrough does.

## Conventions

- **Maker-checker** is defined once in [`system/cross-cutting.md`](./system/cross-cutting.md); flow docs reference it.
- Entity **field shapes** are defined once in the OpenAPI component schemas. [`system/data-model.md`](./system/data-model.md) owns the ER map and persistence design. Flow docs link, they do not re-define.
- Every flow doc follows the same 8-section shape: purpose, entry points, actors, entities, **business rules**, maker-checker, state machine, edge cases.
- Flow docs deliberately do **not** carry "target API endpoints", "backend responsibilities" or "current mock implementation" sections. Those were removed on 2026-08-08 — 1,151 lines that restated the spec, the Java tree and the mock source, none of which they could keep in sync. Read the enforced source instead.
- A dated audit or review is **not** a doc. Its findings belong in the register (if actionable), in open-questions (if a decision), or in a standing ruling (if settled). Four such reviews were deleted on 2026-08-08 after every finding was traced to one of those homes.
