# Flow: Users Management & KYC / Verification

> The admin users desk: list and filter every account, grant/remove the opt-in Verified badge for
> owners and buyers, suspend / ban and flag bad actors, archive/restore, and keep a full activity
> timeline and audit trail. Verification is a **badge, not a gate** (ADR-019): granting it is a
> trust/ranking signal, never a prerequisite to post or contact.
> **Status:** documented from React source · re-synced to ADR-019 (badge-not-gate) - **Primary role(s):** admin / manager (staff with the Users module)

## 1. Purpose & user problem
- **Persona:** a back-office operator responsible for account integrity - approving genuine owners,
  suspending fraudsters, and answering "who is this user and what have they done?"
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Find an account, confirm its identity (KYC), and take the right moderation
  action, leaving an auditable record."
- **Why it matters:** a verified owner earns a trust badge that buyers rely on, and suspension is the
  lever that removes bad actors. This desk is the human side of the trust system that
  [`property-verification.md`](./property-verification.md) applies to supply.

## 2. Entry points
- **Routes:** `/admin/users`.
- **Tiles / triggers:** admin dashboard "users" KPI; per-row action buttons (verify, suspend, flag,
  archive/restore, view activity); bulk action bar when rows are selected.
- **Source components:**
  - `src/pages/admin/AdminUsers.jsx` - table, filters, single + bulk actions, timeline modal.
  - `src/components/ui/InternalNote.jsx` (`submitNote`) - reviewer notes.
  - `src/components/ui/Table.jsx` / `Badge.jsx` / `Modal.jsx` - presentation.

## 3. Actors & roles
- **Checker = admin / manager**, or a staff member whose custom role grants the `users` module
  (`ModuleRoute moduleKey="users"` in `src/App.jsx`, inside `RoleRoute roles={['admin','manager']}`).
- **Subjects** are `owner`, `buyer`, `staff`, and `admin` accounts (`ROLE_OPTS`).
- Guards are UX-only (cross-cutting section 1); real authorization must be server-side.

## 4. Entities touched
- [`users`](../../system/data-model.md) - **read** (list/filter), **updated** (`verified`,
  `status`, `flagged`), **soft-deleted** (`archived`, `archivedAt`, `archiveReason`).
- [`internalNotes`](../../system/data-model.md) (`internalNotes["user:<id>"]`) - **created**;
  never deleted.
- [`audit_log`](../../system/data-model.md) - **created** on every action.
- **Timeline (read-only join):** `enquiries`, `visits`, `tickets`, `listings`, and `internalNotes`
  are aggregated by the user's mobile/id to build the activity feed (`getUserTimeline`).

## 5. Business rules & logic  *(the meat)*

### 5.1 List, filter, search
- `listUsers(undefined, { includeArchived: true })` loads all accounts including archived;
  the page filters client-side (`rows` memo in `AdminUsers.jsx`):
  - **Role** filter (`owner|buyer|staff|admin`).
  - **Status** filter: `active|suspended|archived`. Choosing `archived` shows only archived rows;
    any other status hides archived rows and matches on `u.status`.
  - **Text** search over `name + mobile + id` (lowercased substring).
- Selection is cleared whenever a filter changes so bulk actions never hit invisible rows.

### 5.2 Grant the Verified badge (the approval action)
- A single toggle: `updateUser(id, { verified: !u.verified })`. Setting `verified: true` grants the
  BadgeCheck trust badge shown in the table and on public surfaces; unsetting removes it. The
  per-user action button reads **"Grant Verified badge"** / **"Remove Verified badge"**.
- Every toggle records context: `submitNote('user', id, note, verified ? 'Verified badge granted' :
  'Verified badge removed')` and `logAudit('User', '<Granted|Removed> Verified badge ... <name> (<id>)')`.
- **Badge grant is staff-decided, not self-service.** The user (maker) opts in and submits a
  government document plus a live selfie through the consumer badge flow; a reviewer works the ops
  identity queue (`/ops/kyc-review`, and `/admin/kyc-review` for the same screen behind the module
  guard), or a manager or admin confirms offline docs here and grants the badge in one step with a
  reason (§6). A reviewer can never decide their own case, and nobody can badge themselves (403).
- **Review claims are soft assignment.** A reviewer may claim a pending case for 30 minutes; a fresh
  claim blocks another reviewer from claiming or deciding, but stale claims are takeable and
  unclaimed cases can still be decided directly.
- **Badge-not-gate (ADR-019):** this `verified` flag is an **opt-in trust/ranking badge**. Owners do
  **not** need to clear any identity gate to post — posting and contact stay at L1 mobile. Uniqueness
  is enforced as **one document → one badge** via the UNIQUE `identity_hash` (ADR-009b), set at
  approval, inside the opt-in badge flow only.
- **Both paths write the same `verified` boolean; the origin is derived.** Earned = an
  `identity_verifications` row in `verified`; hand-granted = `verified` with no such row.
  An earned badge is withdrawn only by **revoking** the identity case (reason required, audited);
  a hand-granted one by the immediate withdraw on this screen. The back-office user payload carries
  the derived `badgeSource` (`identity`/`manual`) so the console disables withdraw on an earned one.
- **Name is locked while verified** - `PATCH /me` with a changed name answers 409
  `NAME_LOCKED_WHILE_VERIFIED`; the badge vouches for that name. The identity approval itself
  intentionally overwrites `users.name` with the reviewer-confirmed holder name and audits the
  before/after change.
- **Review SLA.** The age column turns amber at 24h and red ("overdue") at 48h pending, and the
  Overdue filter asks the server for the same 48h cut; a case unreviewed for 14 days
  (`draazy.identity.pending-ttl`) is auto-rejected as `not_reviewed`, images purged and the attempt
  window reset so the user can resubmit at once.
- **The KYC desk.** Three tabs, 10 cases a page, every filter a server query
  (`GET /moderation/identity-reviews?status=&q=&docType=&claim=&overdue=&outcome=&sort=`, counts
  from `/moderation/identity-reviews/summary`):
  - *Needs review* (`pending`) — the work. Claim chips All / Unclaimed / Mine n/3 /
    Others replace a separate "my cases" tab, since a reviewer holds at most three.
  - *Appeals* (`appeal`) — rejections the applicant asked to have checked again; uphold or reopen.
  - *Decided* (`verified`/`rejected`/`revoked`, Outcome chips) — revoke a badge or
    read a case's history.

  Every tab is newest first; the back office has no sort toggle.

  A row opens one case in a dialog: document images beside the applicant's entries and a per-document
  checklist (Approve stays disabled until every line is ticked — the server cannot judge a photo),
  the selfie and pose in their own group, history collapsed, and every action in one rail. Opening a
  pending case claims it; closing it or moving to Next case releases the claim. A case someone else
  holds is not claimed on open — the reviewer sees "Being reviewed by X" and no decide forms.
- **Document already on another account** (409 `identity_already_registered`): the user can report
  misuse from their recent submit conflict (`POST /me/verification/identity/dispute`), which opens
  an `identity_dispute` support ticket; the staff-only link to the holder's case is in the `identity.dispute.opened` audit entry.
  If upheld, staff revoke the holder's case and the reporter resubmits.
- **Consent** is shown in English only (the app is English-only); the client always sends
  `consent_language = en`, stored next to `consent_notice_version`. The column still accepts
  `hi`/`mr` for rows recorded before the switch.

### 5.3 Moderation actions (single)
`confirmAction` in `AdminUsers.jsx` switches on the action type, writes an audit entry, and patches
local state. Each carries a **reason**, typed into the action modal's own textarea — not the shared
`InternalNote` widget, which is collapsed behind a disclosure and would let a mandatory field be
missed:
| Action | Write | Audit |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Verify | `verified` toggled | "Verified"/"Unverified" |
| Suspend / Reactivate | `status` toggled `suspended` <-> `active` | "Suspended"/"Reactivated" |
| Flag / Unflag | `flagged` toggled | "Flagged"/"Unflagged" (soft signal for later review) |
| Archive | `archiveRecord('users', id, 'Archived by admin')` | `archived=true`; "Archived" |
| Restore | `restoreRecord('users', id, 'active')` | `archived=false`, `status='active'`; "Restored" |

- **Suspend** is the ban lever: a suspended account keeps its data but is treated as inactive.
  Its access tokens stop working at once (`users.sessions_revoked_at`), and an owner's listings
  are hidden from search and the property page, taking no new visits or contacts, until reactivated.
- **Archive** is soft-delete (cross-cutting section 4); restore reactivates.
- A **staff note** on the account is a separate, deliberate act — see 5.6 — because the reason for a
  decision and what the team knows about a person are different records with different lifetimes.

### 5.4 Bulk actions
Gated by the `users.bulkOps` admin flag. Each iterates the selected ids and writes one audit entry:
- `runBulkVerify` (bulk button **"Grant badge"**) -> `updateUser(id, { verified: true })`.
- `runBulkSuspend` -> `updateUser(id, { status: 'suspended' })`.
- `runBulkArchive` -> `archiveRecord('users', id, 'Bulk archive')`.
Each is confirmed via a modal (`bulkConfirm`) before running.

### 5.5 Activity timeline (context for a decision)
`getUserTimeline(userId)` builds a newest-first feed by joining on the
user's `mobile` (and `id` for owners):
1. Account creation (`joinedAt`).
2. Enquiries sent (`enquiries` where `mobile` matches; labelled visit / callback / enquiry).
3. Visits scheduled (`visits`; completed / cancelled / scheduled).
4. Service tickets (`tickets`; with team + value).
5. Listings owned (owners only; title + status).
Gated by the `users.timeline` flag; opened via the Eye action.

Notes are **not** on this feed. `GET /users/{id}/timeline` is administrator-only and its `kind`
union has no `note`, while notes are readable by any staffer holding `notes:read` — collapsing the
two would have narrowed the readership of a note to the narrower of the two routes. They render in
their own panel above the feed instead (5.6).

### 5.6 Staff notes on the account
The same `note` domain the property console uses, with `entityType: 'user'`:
`GET|POST /admin/notes/user/{id}`. Append-only, author resolved server-side
from the token, no per-team walls — any staffer or administrator reads any note, deliberately.
Rendered as `data-testid="user-notes"` inside the Activity modal, with an explicit empty state
rather than an absent panel, so "nobody has written one" is distinguishable from "the read failed".

### 5.7 CSV export
`users.csvExport` flag enables exporting the current filtered rows
(ID, Name, Mobile, Role, City, Listings, Joined, Verified, Status) via `exportCsv`.

### 5.7 What MUST move server-side
- The `verified` grant (trust badge is a server-owned attribute, not client-settable).
- Suspend/ban enforcement (a suspended user must actually be blocked, not just badged).
- Archived-row visibility (archived accounts must be excluded from unauthorized reads).
- The timeline join (server-side aggregation with proper access control over PII).

## 6. Maker-checker / approval
| Path | Maker | Checker | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Earned badge (document + selfie) | the user (submits case) | identity reviewer (`identity:write`) | service 403 when reviewer = subject |
| Hand-granted badge | - | single manager or admin (`PATCH /users/{id}/badge`), reason 10..300 | service 403 when actor = subject; 409 if already verified; audited `user.badge` |
| Revoke earned badge | - | single admin, reason 10..300 | protective direction; audited |
| Withdraw hand-granted badge | - | single manager or admin, reason | protective direction; audited |

Every decision and every staff detail view of a case (it mints signed image URLs) writes an audit
row. See [`../../system/cross-cutting.md`](../../system/cross-cutting.md) section 2.
A single approval is final: there is no second-review sample. The approver or another reviewer can still revoke the badge with a reason.

**Approval checks (in order):** the number the reviewer types is the source of truth for the
dedup hash. A hash already verified on another account is a hard stop (409
`identity_already_registered`). When the case carries a pose challenge (`left` / `right` /
`smile`, issued by `POST /me/verification/identity/challenge`, HMAC-signed to the user, 15 min), the
reviewer must tick "selfie shows the pose" (400 `identity_pose_unconfirmed`). A typed number that
differs from the applicant's entry is a soft stop (409 `identity_number_mismatch`); a
`numberOverride` is stored (`number_overridden`), audited. The dev
`simulate` system actor skips both human checks.

## 7. State machine
- **`status`:** `active <-> suspended`; `active|suspended --(archive)--> archived --(restore)--> active`.
- **`verified`:** `false <-> true` (independent boolean; not a lifecycle stage).
- **Identity case:** `none → pending → verified | rejected`; `verified → revoked`; `rejected|revoked
  → pending` (resubmit, 3 per 24h); `pending → rejected(not_reviewed)` after 14 days unreviewed
  (images purged, attempt not consumed); any state → withdrawn on user withdrawal (DPDP: images
  and claims erased, badge removed; the row keeps the attempt window, and a revoked or not_holder
  case keeps its document hash so withdrawal cannot launder a fraud block). Reads as `none` to the
  user.
- **`flagged`:** `false <-> true` (advisory marker; does not change access).
- **Terminal-ish:** `archived` (re-openable by restore, which forces `status='active'`).

## 8. Edge cases, validation & error states
- **Loading:** `<Loading />` until `all` resolves.
- **Empty / filtered-out:** the table renders its empty state ("Nothing matches this filter.").
- **Selection safety:** selection resets on any filter/role/status change.
- **Optional note:** action modals accept an optional note; the action still records its label even
  when the note is blank (`addInternalNote` saves when text OR an action label is present).
- **Idempotent toggles:** verify/suspend/flag are toggles; re-applying flips back (no dedicated
  "already verified" error).
- **Concurrency:** last write wins on the shared store; no locking.

## User administration

Rationale relocated from `UserAdminService` Javadoc.

- **Masked list, audited reveal.** `GET /users` masks mobiles and writes no audit row; `GET
  /users/{id}` reveals the number and records who looked. Ops genuinely need a phone number to act
  on a case, but a paged list hands over thousands per request - one deliberate, individually
  logged read per person keeps the cost of exfiltration linear and leaves a trail naming whose data
  was read.
- **Moderation lives next door.** Suspension, the identity badge and the internal review flag are
  in `UserModerationService`: decisions about a person, as opposed to administration of the
  directory row.
- **Search wildcards are neutralised.** `likePrefix` escapes `%`/`_`/`\` and anchors the
  pattern, so `?q=%` cannot become an unanchored scan the `text_pattern_ops` index cannot serve.
  The escape character is declared in the query, so the two must agree.
- **Email collisions are caught in the service.** `update` and `restore` both compare
  case-insensitively against V70's `lower(email)` partial unique index. Without the guard the
  flush hits the index and the operator sees a generic conflict naming neither field nor account.
- **Restore is the dangerous one.** Archiving is a soft delete, so an address can legitimately be
  re-used while the first account sits archived. Restoring it then puts two live rows on one
  address, and `AuthService#staffLogin` uses an `Optional`-returning lookup - two rows is an
  `IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException`, i.e. a 500 on every later sign-in for both people,
  with no route back through the console. Answered 409 (the platform's state forbids it, not the
  caller's entitlement) with a message naming the address and the way out.
- **Archive floors.** An admin may not archive themselves, nor the last remaining administrator:
  restore is admin-only, so either would lock the platform out of its own back office with no
  in-product recovery. 409, for the same reason as above.

## Account moderation

Rationale relocated from `UserModerationService` Javadoc.

- **Suspension is not archiving.** Archiving is the soft delete and every read path filters the
  account out - right for someone who has gone, wrong for someone under investigation, because it
  hides the account from the colleagues who need to look at it.
- **A suspension is only real because `AuthService` enforces it.** Writing the column alone would
  produce a button that changes a badge while the person kept signing in. The refusal sits on every
  path that mints a session, including refresh, and existing refresh families are revoked so the
  window closes to the access-token TTL rather than at some unpredictable point in the next hour.
- **Guarded like archiving** - not yourself, not the last administrator - and idempotent, so two
  moderators reaching the same conclusion do not get a conflict.
- **Reactivation is deliberately narrow.** It refuses an archived account, because that state
  belongs to `UserAdminService#restore` and its live-email collision guard; promoting an archived
  row here would leave `archived = true` with `status = active`, a row invisible to the
  directory that claims to be fine.
- **The manual badge exists because the document-and-selfie flow cannot reach everybody** - a
  company account, or a person an administrator has met and whose documents they have seen. Without
  it those people are permanently unverifiable and the judgement moves off-platform. Because it
  skips the `identity_hash` dedup, every grant carries a written reason and an audit entry. There is
  one administrator, so a second-admin approval could never complete; a manager or the admin
  decides it directly. The old maker-checker table `badge_grant_requests` was dropped in V118.
- **Withdrawing an earned badge is refused here** - doubt about the verification is an action
  against the verification record (revoke), which keeps the evidence and the reason together.
- **Badge changes propagate in both directions** to the person's listings, flatmate seeker posts and
  group seats (and so the "verified only" filter), because the badge is sold on being the same claim
  everywhere it shows.
- **The flag has no self-check and no last-administrator guard.** It takes nothing away, so there is
  nothing to lock yourself out of. A reason is required and validated in the service so the operator
  gets a sentence rather than a constraint violation.
- **The timeline loads the user first** so a mistyped id answers 404; an empty timeline is a real
  and common answer for a fresh account, and would otherwise read as "this person has done nothing".

## Back office user view

Rationale relocated from `BackOfficeUserView` Javadoc.

It owns one decision - *what a back-office caller is allowed to see of another person* - and is
shared by two services that otherwise have nothing to do with each other (`UserAdminService`,
which administers the directory, and `UserModerationService`, which acts on a person). It is not a
`XService` + `XServiceHelper` split of the kind `package-structure.md` section 4.1 warns
against; duplicating the masking rule in both callers would be the real hazard, because the two
copies would drift and the drift would be one of them quietly serving an unmasked mobile.

**The masking asymmetry it holds.** A list masks; a single-user read does not, and writes an audit
row for the reveal. Ops genuinely need a phone number to act on a case, so refusing it would push
the work off-platform - but a paged list hands over thousands of numbers per request for the cost of
one click, which is a bulk-export surface wearing the clothes of a search screen.
