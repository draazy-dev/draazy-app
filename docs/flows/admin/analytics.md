# Flow: Admin Analytics

> The insight console: 6 analytics tabs (Traffic, Engagement, Funnel, Supply Gap, Pricing, SLA) plus the
> Dashboard KPI tiles, all read from server reports, with one report-window selector in the page header.
> **Status:** documented from React source - **Primary role(s):** admin (with the Analytics module)

---

## 1. Purpose & user problem
- **Persona:** a growth / operations lead who needs to see demand, supply, pricing, funnel and SLA health at a glance.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Show me traffic and conversion, where demand outruns supply, whether listings are
  mispriced, how the ops team is doing against SLA, and how Pune's seasons will move the market."
- **Why it matters:** this is the decision layer above every operational flow - it tells ops where to source
  supply, which localities to prioritise, and whether SLAs (feeding [`services-moderation.md`](./services-moderation.md)
  and property verification) are being met. The funnel here complements [`enquiries-funnel.md`](./enquiries-funnel.md).

## 2. Entry points
- **Routes:** `/admin/analytics?tab=<key>` (default `traffic`). Tab keys: `traffic`, `engagement`, `funnel`, `supply-gap`,
  `pricing`, `sla`; any other key (including the retired `geography`, `seasonal`, `surfers`) falls back to Traffic.
  The Dashboard (`/admin`) surfaces KPI tiles + SLA panels that link into these tabs (e.g. `?tab=supply-gap`).
- **Tiles / triggers:** a header `Report window` select (30/90/180 days, shown on every tab except Pricing),
  per-tab KPI cards, charts, and drill tables; CSV export on the Traffic tab.
- **Source components:**
  - `src/pages/admin/AdminAnalytics.jsx` - tab shell, window state, header picker.
  - `src/pages/admin/analytics/*.jsx` - the tab views + `constants.jsx` (palette, axes, `Card`).
  - `src/lib/data/analytics-extra.js` (barrel) -> `analytics/*.js` slices (all real aggregation logic).
  - Dashboard: `src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx` + `dashboard/*Panel.jsx`.

## 3. Actors & roles
- **Operator = admin** with the `analytics` module (atom `dashboard:read`, `flagKey: 'analytics'`). Each tab is gated by an
  `analytics.<key>` admin option flag (`analytics.traffic|engagement|anonymous|geography|supplyGap|pricing|sla|seasonal`,
  all seed `true`); a disabled tab is removed and its data generator is skipped.
- Dashboard panels are gated by `dash.sla|glanceRevenue|glanceTraffic`.
- Guards are UX-only mock RBAC ([`../../system/cross-cutting.md`](../../system/cross-cutting.md) section 1).

## 4. Entities touched
- **Read only** (no writes; analytics is pure aggregation): [`listings`](../../system/data-model.md),
  [`enquiries`](../../system/data-model.md), [`visits`](../../system/data-model.md),
  [`deals`](../../system/data-model.md), [`tickets`](../../system/data-model.md),
  [`users`](../../system/data-model.md), [`localities`](../../system/data-model.md),
  `analytics.sources`, and runtime signals (`searchIntents`, `propertyViews`, `demandAlerts`, `demandPosts`,
  `staffActivity`) plus localStorage (dismissed alerts).
- [`city_waitlist`](../../system/data-model.md) — read **aggregated only**, through
  `GET /admin/cities/waitlist`. The rows carry contact details; the endpoint groups them away in SQL
  and returns counts, so this tab never holds a mobile or an email.
- `analytics.traffic` / `analytics.revenue` seed rows feed Dashboard tiles.

## 5. Business rules & logic  *(the meat)*
All generators live in `src/lib/data/analytics/*.js` and are deterministic: a linear-congruential
`rng(seed)` (`s = (s*1664525 + 1013904223) >>> 0; s/2^32`) and date helpers (`iso`, `daysAgo`) from `internals.js`.
Fixed seeds keep every chart stable across renders.

### 5.1 Traffic tab (`trafficSeries(days)`, seed 424242)
Per day for the last `days` (30/90/180): `base = 1400 + (days - i) * 14`; weekend factor `wknd = 0.8` on Sat/Sun else 1.
- `visits    = round((base + rng()*600) * wknd)`
- `pageviews = round((base*3.4 + rng()*1800) * wknd)`
- `signups   = round((18 + rng()*26) * wknd)`
Charts: Visits & page views line; Traffic sources doughnut (from `analytics.sources`); Device split
(sample 64/30/6) and New vs returning (sample) marked "Sample". CSV export = `[Date, Visits, Page views, Signups]`.

### 5.2 Engagement tab (all "Sample")
Static illustrative series over `WK12`: avg session minutes `3.2..4.5`, bounce `48..37%`, top-pages index bar
(Home 100 down to Post property 22). No DB derivation - labelled Sample.

### 5.3 Anonymous surfers tab (`anonymousSurfers(days, traffic)`, seed 987654)
- `totalVisits = sum(visits)`, `totalSignups = sum(signups)` over the (shared) traffic series.
- `signedInSessions = min(totalSignups * 12, totalVisits)` (assume each signup visits ~12x); `anonSessions = totalVisits - signedInSessions`.
- **KPIs:** `anonPct = round(anonSessions/totalVisits*100)`; `conversionRate = (totalSignups/totalVisits*100).toFixed(1)`;
  Anonymous visits = `anonSessions`; Signups in period = `totalSignups`.
- `anonPages`: 8 pages, `views = round(anonSessions * factor)` (Home 0.92 ... Flatmates 0.09) with per-page `signupRate`.
- Weekly split (8 buckets): `signedIn = min(wSignups * (11 + rng()*3), wVisits)`, `anon = wVisits - signedIn`.
- `dropOff`: fixed exit-point percentages (contact wall 34%, etc.).

### 5.4 Geography tab — removed
It charted ~155 localities in 360px bars (unreadable), and its demand index and ₹/sqft were curated
seed constants. Locality demand now lives on Supply Gap, measured prices on Pricing.

### 5.4a Funnel tab (`GET /admin/analytics/funnel?days=`, `AdminFunnelService`)
Weekly (IST, Monday-start, zero-filled) counts of five stages over the window (1–365 days, default 90):
- **Posted** — non-archived `properties.created_at`.
- **Approved** — the first approval audit row per non-archived listing: `property.status` → `approved`, or the console's case-file / second-approver `property.verification.decision` = `approve` (re-approvals don't recount).
- **Contacts** — `contact_requests.created_at` (requests sent; there is no reliable approval timestamp).
- **Visits** — `visits.created_at`. **Deals** — `deals.closed_at` where `status = 'closed'`.

Each stage counts events in the week they happened, not one cohort followed through, so the tiles'
"% of previous" is window throughput. The lowest step is called out as the biggest drop; a stage after a zero shows `—`.

### 5.5 Supply Gap tab (`GET /admin/supply-gap?days=`)
Per-locality supply vs weighted demand over the header window:
- `supply` = approved, non-archived listings per locality.
- `demand` = `searches*2 + alerts*5`. Views are reported but **not** weighted: they grow with supply, so
  counting them ranked well-stocked areas as under-served.
- `demandPerListing = round1(demand / (supply + 1))`; rows sort by it desc, then by `demand`. The
  no-locality row is always last and gets no priority.
- **Tab KPIs:** Under-served (High or Medium), Well-served (OK), Total demand, Total supply,
  Property views (`<days>d`), Hot demand users. Priority chip: High if `demandPerListing>=5 || repeatSeekers>=2`,
  Medium if `>=1`, else OK (thresholds named in `SupplyGapTab.jsx`).
- A failed read shows a notice instead of zeroed KPIs; the city panel below still renders.
- **Demand Alerts by locality** (`alertsByLocality()`): groups `demandAlerts` by locality -> `{count, lastAt, rent, buy, topType}`, sorted by count.
- **City Expansion Requests** (`GET /admin/cities/waitlist` via `cityService.listCityWaitlist()`):
  where people want Draazy to launch **next** — a different question from the rest of this tab,
  which compares supply and demand *inside* a city already served. Rows are
  `{ city, requests, lastRequestedAt }`, grouped in SQL by `lower(city)` and ordered by `requests`
  desc then recency; displayed spelling is `min(city)`, a real one somebody typed. The panel is
  **counts-only by design** — `city_waitlist` holds unverified public mobiles and emails, and the
  aggregation happens in the database so no contact detail reaches the JVM, let alone this screen.
  There is no `?days=` window: wanting a city does not decay.
  It previously aggregated a `dzCityRequests` array in localStorage, so it showed the reading
  operator only the asks made from *their own* browser — always none on a fresh profile, while
  `POST /cities/waitlist` had been recording the real ones all along.
  The waitlist is held as `null`-until-loaded rather than `[]`: a failed read renders
  "Couldn't load city requests", never "No city requests yet", because the second sentence would
  close the expansion queue on the strength of an outage. `cityProvider.listCityWaitlist` **throws**
  on a non-array 200 for the same reason — coercing to `[]` there would resolve the promise and
  defeat the distinction from below. The failed state carries a **Try again** button wired to an
  attempt counter in the effect's deps: nothing else on this tab re-runs the read, so without it
  the panel would warn against misreading the outage and then offer no way to resolve it.

### 5.6 Pricing tab (`GET /admin/analytics/pricing`)
- **Asking ₹/sqft and rental yield are measured from approved flats only** (`property_type_key = 'flat'`,
  `area > 0`), and are null unless the locality has at least `MIN_SAMPLE = 3` such flats — plots and
  shops are not priced per sqft like flats, and one listing cannot speak for a locality.
- Market rate, avg rent and demand are curated reference figures, labelled as such on the tab.
- **Summary KPIs:** localities priced, overpriced/underpriced/fair counts (±10% of market rate), avg yield,
  highest/lowest market rate. The chart draws only priced localities. No window: it is a live snapshot.
- Locality breakdown table (opportunity chip: High if `demand>=85 && totalListings<=2`, Moderate if
  `demand>=75`, else Stable).

### 5.7 SLA tab (`slaMetrics()`, seed 314159)
Targets (hours): `listingApproval 24`, `servicePickup 4`, `serviceDelivery 72`, `conciergeToLive 168`.
Four categories, each simulating a time and a per-item `breached = time > target`:
- **Listing approval:** reviewed listings get `hoursToApprove = round((2 + rng()*30)*10)/10`; pending listings get real
  `hoursWaiting = round((now-createdAt)/3600000)`, `breaching` if `> 24`. `avgApprovalTime` = mean; `approvalSlaRate =
  round((n - breaches)/n*100)` (100 when none); `currentlyBreaching` = pending over 24h.
- **Service pickup:** assigned tickets get `hoursToPickup = round((0.5 + rng()*6)*10)/10`; `avgPickupTime`, `pickupSlaRate`,
  `unassignedCount` = tickets without `assignedTo`.
- **Service delivery:** done tickets get `hoursToDeliver = round((12 + rng()*80)*10)/10`; `avgDeliveryTime`, `deliverySlaRate`,
  `inProgressCount`.
- **Concierge pipeline:** `postedByAdmin` listings that are live/approved get `hoursToLive = round((48 + rng()*150)*10)/10`;
  `avgConciergeTime`, `conciergeSlaRate`, `pendingConcierge`.
- **Aggregate:** `totalBreaches` = sum of category breaches; `overallSlaRate` = mean of the 4 SLA rates. Plus a 4-week
  simulated `weeklyTrend`. Tab KPIs surface overall + per-category avg/rate + total breaches with colour thresholds (>=90 green, >=75 amber).

### 5.7a Server-side SLA semantics (`GET /admin/analytics/sla`, `AdminSlaService`)
Pinned by `AdminSlaAnalyticsTest`. Targets are served in the response so no client carries its own copy:
`listing review 24h`, `ticket pickup 4h`, `ticket delivery 72h`, `conciergeToLive 168h`.
- **Review turnaround is the *first* `property.status` decision**, not the latest and not the mean of
  all of them. A re-check on a live listing is a second look at a decision already taken, not a second
  first decision. A rejection counts as a review — the queue was worked, not skipped.
- **The audit join matches `entity_id` against the id *or* the slug.** `audit_log.entity_id` is free
  text and the moderation surfaces have not always agreed which identifier goes in it. Dropping the
  `or` branch would silently stop counting older decisions and *improve* the reported average, because
  those listings stay in the pending backlog.
- **Empty means null, not zero.** `avgHoursToReview`, `medianHoursToReview` and `slaRatePct` are null
  when nothing was reviewed: there is no average of nothing, and a team with no decisions has not met
  the SLA. `breachedCount` stays 0, which is a true count rather than a derived figure.
- **`?days=` filters on when the work was *finished*** — the decision or completion instant, never
  `created_at`. The backlog counts are present-tense and are deliberately not narrowed by the window.
- **A listing waits from `coalesce(resubmitted_at, created_at)`**, matching the review queue, so an
  edited listing is not reported overdue for its whole age. Reviewed is not filtered on the current
  status: a listing since sold, paused or resubmitted was still decided.
- **Ticket pickup is the first real assignment recorded in `audit_log`**, not `tickets.assignee_id`
  (a re-queued ticket has it back to null) and not the latest assignment row (`assigneeId: "none"` is
  an unassignment, not a pickup). Delivery counts `closed` as well as `resolved`: a desk that closes a
  request has finished with it, and recognising only `resolved` grows the backlog every time somebody
  tidies up.
- **Concierge measures the decision that put the listing *live***, not the first look at it, and is
  filtered to `posted_by_admin` — otherwise it reports the whole catalogue's approval time under a
  heading about staff-posted listings. A rejected concierge listing is finished with, not outstanding.

### 5.8 Seasonal tab (`seasonalAnalytics()`, seed 112233)
Pune-specific monthly multipliers (12 each): `rentMultiplier` (peak Jun-Aug), `buyMultiplier` (peak Oct-Nov),
`visitMultiplier` (monsoon dip Jul-Sep).
- `monthlyDemand[m]`: `rental = round(100*rentMult)`, `buying = round(100*buyMult)`, `visits = round(100*visitMult)`,
  `combined = round(100*(rentMult*0.55 + buyMult*0.45))`.
- **Per-locality curve** by `loc.focus` (Rent/Buy/Both): `demand = round(base * mult * (0.95 + rng()*0.1))`;
  `peakDemand`/`lowDemand` = max/min of the curve; peak/slow months derived from focus.
- `yoyGrowth`: 3-year simulated series; `events`: 6 fixed market events; `recommendations`: rule-based on the
  **current** month's multipliers (e.g. rent `>=1.2` -> "prioritize rental sourcing"; visits `<=0.8` -> "push virtual tours").

### 5.9 Dashboard KPIs (adjacent, `AdminDashboard.jsx`)
- **Needs-attention tiles** (live counts): Pending Verification (`status==='pending'`), Needs Follow-up
  (stale >48h pending + concierge owners missing photos or the Verified badge, deduped), Flagged (`status==='flagged'`),
  New Enquiries (`status==='new'`), Scheduled Visits (`status==='scheduled'`), New Service Requests (`status==='new'`),
  Deals in Progress (`status==='in_progress'`), Owner KYC Pending (`role==='owner' && !verified` — owners
  without the **opt-in** Verified badge; a growth nudge, not a posting/contact gate, per ADR-019).
- **At-a-glance:** Total Users (buyer+owner), Active Listings (`approved`) / total, Revenue this month
  (`subscriptions+services+featured` of last `analytics.revenue` row, MoM via `pct`), Total Deals, Signups today
  (last traffic row), Visits today + `visits30` (sum).
- **SLA health** (`dashboard/SlaHealthPanel.jsx`, D291): the four compliance rates `GET /admin/analytics/sla` answers (listing approval, ticket pickup, service delivery, concierge to live) with each track's late-now count; a null rate renders "Not recorded". Smart Alerts and the Daily Ops Scorecard were deleted: no route sources them.
- **Platform health** dots read live from `settings.flags` (maintenanceMode, signupsEnabled, staffLoginEnabled, services on, whatsappEnabled).

### 5.10 Time ranges & filters
- **Report window** `days` (30/90/180), in the page header, drives Traffic, Engagement, Funnel, Supply Gap and SLA
  (SLA windows decisions only; the backlog is always live). Pricing and the city waitlist have no window.
- Tab visibility is driven by `analytics.<key>` flags; the whole page needs the `analytics` module flag.

### 5.11 What MUST move server-side
- **Everything.** Traffic, surfers, SLA, seasonal, ops-scorecard and price/6-month trends are seeded-RNG **simulations**,
  not measurements. Real telemetry (visits, pageviews, signups, session/bounce) and real timestamps (created/assigned/
  resolved/approved) must come from the server.
- The fragile locality parse (`split(' in ')`) and the demand-weighting constants (+1/+0.5/+2/+3, 0.4 fallback) must be
  replaced by real joins on `localitySlug` and a governed demand model.
- Deviation/yield/opportunity thresholds and SLA targets should be server-config, and the funnel/KPIs authoritative.

## 6. Maker-checker / approval
- **Not applicable.** Analytics is read-only reporting - no proposals, approvals, or mutations. (Dashboard tiles link
  into flows that do have maker-checker, e.g. property verification and visits.)

## 7. State machine
- No entity lifecycle is owned here. The only "states" are categorical labels the views compute for display:
  pricing `overpriced|underpriced|fair`, supply-gap priority `High|Medium|OK`, SLA `breached/breaching`, and
  seasonal recommendation `opportunity|caution|strategy`. These are derived each render, not transitions.

## 8. Edge cases, validation & error states
- **Flag gating:** disabled tabs are filtered out (`.filter(Boolean)`); their generators are skipped via memo guards.
- **Divide-by-zero guards:** SLA rates default to 100 when no items; pricing skips null `marketPrice`; `maxDemand/maxSupply`
  use `Math.max(..., 1)`; anonymous rates guard on `totalVisits`.
- **Empty signals:** Supply Gap shows friendly empty states when there are no demand alerts / city requests.
- **Sample labelling:** non-derived charts carry a "Sample" chip so illustrative data is not mistaken for real.
- **Determinism:** fixed RNG seeds mean values are stable per session but change with the mock DB contents / current date.
