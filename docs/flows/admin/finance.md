# Flow: Admin Finance

> The platform-economics console: revenue by month, subscription MRR, services,
> a transaction ledger and the plan book.
> **Status:** documented from React source - **Primary role(s):** admin (with the Finance module)

---

## 1. Purpose & user problem
- **Persona:** a finance / growth lead who owns the platform P&L.
- **Job-to-be-done:** "Show me what Draazy earned this month, where it came from
  (subscriptions vs services),
  and let me drill into individual transactions."
- **Why it matters:** this is the money view of the marketplace. It rolls up the
  monetisation from every other flow (owner/seeker plans and service tickets) into
  revenue, MRR and net-retained figures. It sits at
  the bottom of the funnel that [`enquiries-funnel.md`](./enquiries-funnel.md) tracks.

## 2. Entry points
- **Routes:** `/admin/finance` (single page, no tabs). The Dashboard "Revenue (this month)"
  glance tile links to `/admin/settings`, but Finance itself is opened from the sidebar
  and cross-linked from the "Deal Pipeline" card to `/admin/enquiries`.
- **Tiles / triggers:** 5 KPI tiles, a Revenue-by-month bar chart with a 6/12/24-month
  window selector, a revenue-mix doughnut, an MRR line, Subscriptions and Net-position
  panels, and a filterable transactions table with a per-row detail modal. The console's
  composition today is: subscriptions, services, refunds, MRR, ARPU/ARPPU and
  the plan book - no paid-placement band or tile, no rent band, no rent-pay fee tile, no payouts.
- **Source components:**
  - `src/pages/admin/AdminFinance.jsx` - KPIs, charts, panels, transaction table + modal, CSV export.
  - `src/lib/data/finance-admin.js` - `buildTransactions()`, `buildRevenueSeries()`.
  - Chart primitives `src/components/charts/index.jsx`; money formatting `src/lib/format.js` (`fmtINR`, `fmtNum`).

## 3. Actors & roles
- **Operator = admin** with the `finance` module. `finance:read` is one of the six
  administrator-only atoms, so it can never be granted to an operations account. The module is gated by the
  `finance` admin flag (`ADMIN_MODULES` in `src/lib/adminModules.js`, `flagKey: 'finance'`);
  when the flag is off the module is hidden from nav and route.
- Sub-panels are further gated by admin option flags read via `useAdminFlags().optionEnabled`:
  `finance.charts`, `finance.models`, `finance.transactions` (all default `true` in the seed).
- Guards are UX-only (mock RBAC) - see [`../../system/cross-cutting.md`](../../system/cross-cutting.md) section 1.

## 4. Entities touched
- [`settings.fees`](../../system/data-model.md) - **read** (fee schedule).
- [`analytics.revenue`](../../system/data-model.md) - **read** (per-month subscriptions/services series; services is zero until measured).
- `users` - **read** for ARPU/ARPPU; paying users are active subscribers only.
- Nothing is written here - Finance is entirely read/aggregate today (no audit rows, no mutations).

## 5. Business rules & logic  *(the meat)*

### 5.1 Source series
- `series = buildRevenueSeries(24)` returns 24 monthly rows `{ month, subscriptions, services }`.
  - `subscriptions` is the only measured revenue source today.
  - `services` is carried as an always-zero band until service-order revenue is measured.
  - `month` label = `toLocaleDateString('en-IN', { month: 'short', year: '2-digit' })`.
- `month = series[last]`, `prev = series[last-1] || month`.
- `slicedSeries = series.slice(-range)` where `range` in {6, 12, 24} drives the bar chart / MRR line.

### 5.2 Headline aggregates
- `monthTotal = month.subscriptions + month.services`.
- `prevTotal  = prev.subscriptions + prev.services`.
- `ytd = sum over the last 12 rows of (subscriptions + services)` (the "Revenue (12 mo)" KPI).
- `pct(cur, prev)` MoM delta = `round((cur - prev) / prev * 1000) / 10`, rendered as `+/-N%`;
  returns `null` (no delta shown) when `prev` is falsy.

### 5.3 Fee schedule inputs (`settings.fees`)
Seed values (`src/data/settings.json`): `ownerPlanYearly: 999`, `ownerProYearly: 2499`,
`rentAgreementPlatform: 500`, `seekerPlusTopup: 199`.
- `ownerPlan = fees.ownerPlanMonthly || round(fees.ownerPlanYearly / 12 || 500)`
  (with the seed, `ownerPlanMonthly` is absent so `ownerPlan = round(999/12) = 83`).
- `seekerPlan = fees.seekerPlanMonthly || 299` (seed has no monthly, so `299`).

### 5.4 Subscription split (modelled, not stored)
The subscription line is split into owner vs seeker by a **fixed 55/45 heuristic**:
- `ownerShare = round(month.subscriptions * 0.55)`.
- `ownerSubs  = max(0, round(ownerShare / max(1, ownerPlan)))`.
- `seekerSubs = max(0, round((month.subscriptions - ownerShare) / max(1, seekerPlan)))`.
- The Subscriptions panel renders each row as `count active . fmtINR(price)/mo` and `count * price`,
  and shows `MRR total = month.subscriptions`.

### 5.5 Commission, net position
- `partnerPayout = round(month.services * 0.65)` (partners keep 65% of services revenue).
- `commission    = month.services - partnerPayout` (platform keeps the remaining 35%).
- `netRetained   = monthTotal - partnerPayout`.
- **Net position panel:** revenue in, refunds out. "Partner payouts (65%)" and "Platform
  commission (35%)" were a split of a figure that was itself fabricated, and the payouts
  and unsettled-gateway-fee rows were all facts about the tenant-to-owner rent
  rail. That rail was withdrawn, so those rows are **gone** rather than pinned at a zero an
  operator would read as a quiet month. Refunds keep the marker that says no refund path exists.

### 5.6 ARPU and ARPPU
- `users = db.users.length`; `arpu = round(monthTotal / max(1, users))` (the ARPU KPI).
- `arppu = round(monthTotal / max(1, payingUsers))` (the ARPPU KPI), with `payingUsers` counted from active subscribers only. The two are separate tiles
  because one figure under an unqualified label invites the reader to assume it is the other.

### 5.7 KPI tiles (5)
| KPI | Value | MoM delta |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| MRR (subscriptions) | `month.subscriptions` | `pct(subs, prev.subs)` |
| Revenue this month | `monthTotal` | `pct(monthTotal, prevTotal)` |
| Services revenue | `month.services` | `pct(services, prev.services)` |
| Revenue (12 mo) | `ytd` | none |
| ARPU / ARPPU | `arpu`, `arppu` | none |

### 5.8 Transaction ledger (`buildTransactions`)
A server ledger built from subscription payments, newest-first (sorted by `date` desc):
- `kind` is `subscription`; the old paid-placement kind is gone.
- `services` remains an always-zero series band, not ledger stock.
- There is no `method` column: it was invented here and never sourced, and the rent rail it decorated is gone.
- **Derived outstanding/refunds:** iterate the ledger - `refunds += abs(amount)` for `refunded`,
  `pending += abs(amount)` for `pending`.

### 5.9 Table filtering & export
- `txRows` applies: type filter (`r.type === txType`), status filter (`r.status === txStatus`),
  and free-text search over `(id + party + type).toLowerCase()`.
- `txTypes` = distinct sorted `type` values for the filter dropdown.
- Revenue CSV = the full 24-month `series`; Transactions CSV = the current `txRows`.

### 5.10 What MUST move server-side
- The 55/45 owner/seeker subscription split, the 65/35 partner/commission split, the 0.5%
  sale-facilitation rate and the deterministic revenue fallback are **client-side heuristics**
  that must be replaced by real ledger/subscription accounting on the server.
- The transaction ledger must stay backed by real subscription payment rows with gateway status
  and refund records, not by unrelated product collections.
- Net-retained is computed in the browser from `monthTotal` and must be an
  authoritative server figure.

### 5.11 Disclosed figures: what is measured and what is a structural zero (D63, D65)

Two of the money lines on this screen describe paths the platform **does not have**. Until this
section shipped, they rendered as ordinary numbers, and a structural zero and a measured zero look
identical to an operator:

| Figure | Reality today | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `refunds` (server) / **Refunds (recent)** (screen) | The platform has no refund path at all, so no refund can be recorded. | A literal `0L` in `AdminFinanceService.finance()`. The screen's own figure is derived from *mock* transaction statuses and is not a receipt. |
| Services marketplace inside **revenue** | Excluded. `service_orders.amount` is a quote, and the table carries no column saying money arrived - no `paid_at`, no `paid` status (`26.10.10__DDL_engagement_billing.sql`, folded from the old `V8`, with the status vocabulary widened by the old `V57`). | `AdminMetricsRepository.REVENUE_BY_SOURCE` counts subscriptions only. |

There used to be a third: `payoutsCompleted` / **Partner payouts**. Both the figure and its
disclosure are gone. `payout_accounts` stored *where* a remittance to an owner would go and nothing
ever wrote one; the rail that would have was withdrawn in V127, taking `payoutsMeasured`,
`payoutsCompleted`, `payoutsDue` and `pendingSettlement` with it, along with the
`rent` band in the revenue series. A disclosure explaining why a figure is zero is only worth
carrying while the figure has a reason to be on the screen at all.

**Why disclosed rather than omitted.** Dropping a figure the screen has a slot for makes a rendering
bug and an absent money path into the same blank cell. Keeping the number and attaching a reason
makes the gap legible: the operator sees `₹0`, sees *why* it is zero, and cannot mistake it for a
quiet month. Removing the slot **as well as** the figure, as the payout rows show, is the other
honest option — and the right one once the path is not merely unbuilt but abandoned.

**Which flag turns each one on.** The disclosures are configuration, not data - nothing in the
schema can distinguish "no refunds this month" from "this platform cannot refund", so the answer is
a fact about which slices have shipped. Defaults are today's truth.

| Property (`application.properties`) | Env override | Default | Turns off the disclosure for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `draazy.finance.refunds-measured` | `FINANCE_REFUNDS_MEASURED` | `false` | `refunds` / **Refunds (recent)** |
| `draazy.finance.service-orders-counted` | `FINANCE_SERVICE_ORDERS_COUNTED` | `false` | services inside **revenue** / **Gross revenue** / **Services revenue** KPI |

They are read in `AdminFinanceService`'s constructor via `@Value` and travel on the `AdminFinance`
response as `refundsMeasured` and `serviceOrdersCounted`. Three tests hold the
promise "set the property, no code change" together, and it takes all three:
`AdminFinanceDisclosureTest` pins the defaults; `AdminFinanceDisclosureEnabledTest` proves the
properties actually flip the response; and `AdminFinancePropertyContractTest` reads the real
`src/main/resources/application.properties` off disk and checks it spells the keys the way the
annotations read them - without it, `src/test/resources/application.properties` shadows the deployed
file, so a typo there (`refund-measured` for `refunds-measured`) would leave the first two green
while the env override did nothing in production.

**They disclose; they do not enable.** Setting one `true` does not create the money path behind it -
it only stops the screen from warning that the path is missing. Turning one on before the thing it
describes exists puts the dashboard back to lying quietly, which is the state this section ends.

**Frontend delivery, and its known gap.** `/admin/finance` (the React page) does not call the
backend endpoint - it is entirely mock-driven (`getSettings()` + `rawDb()`), and there is no admin
seam in `src/services/providers/**` (see [`../../system/frontend-data-seam.md`](../../system/frontend-data-seam.md);
a `financeService.js` was deleted for having zero importers). So the page reads the same three flags
from the settings document it already loads:

```
settings.finance.refundsMeasured        // absent or non-true => disclose
settings.finance.serviceOrdersCounted
```

Absent means "not measured" deliberately: a disclosure that defaults to *measured* is an affirmative
claim about a figure, made by a typo. **When the admin http provider lands, these two keys should
be fed from the endpoint's `refundsMeasured` / `serviceOrdersCounted` fields**,
at which point the server property becomes the single source of truth for both halves.

### 5.12 Refunds desk (`/admin/refunds`)
- Back-office function `refunds` (group "Trust & safety"; `refunds:read` lists, `refunds:write` decides; admins
  always). `GET /admin/refunds?status=pending_review|approved|rejected|auto|disputed&counts=true` is paged in the
  house envelope. Rows: `{id, status, kind, label, customerId, customerName, orderRef, amount, basis, customerReason,
  requestedAt, decidedAt, decisionReason, propertyId, creditNoteNo, signals{refunds12m, linkedAccounts, contactsUsed,
  enquiries, pausedDuringWindow}, transaction}`. `signals` is computed only for `pending_review` rows and is null on every other tab. `auto` rows are the system's own refunds (id = order id) and `disputed` rows the gateway disputes.
- `transaction` is the order behind every row: price, paid-at (the invoice time, or for an order that died unpaid
  the moment its refund fell due), order status, invoice number, and once money is due back the refund amount,
  `refundReason` (`paid_after_cancel`, `listing_gone`, `amount_mismatch`, `customer_request`, `gateway_dashboard`,
  stored on `subscriptions.refund_reason`), `refundState` (`queued` → `sent` once Cashfree accepts it →
  `confirmed` once its SUCCESS webhook lands, `subscriptions.refund_settled_at`; `retrying` after a refusal), the
  gateway refund id and attempts. The desk shows the reason in place of the customer's on the Automatic tab.
- The system refunds with no staff decision in three cases: a payment lands on an order already cancelled
  (the customer backed out, or the sweep expired the checkout); a listing pass is paid after its listing was
  archived, rented or sold; or the amount or currency paid is not the order's. Nothing is granted and the sum paid
  goes back.
- `POST /admin/refunds/{id}/approve` re-checks the facts, then queues the refund; `POST .../reject {reason}`
  (required, else 422) restores the entitlement. A second decision, or approving or rejecting while the gateway
  disputes the order, is 409. Both notify the customer (`refund.decided`) and are audited `refund.approved` / `refund.rejected`.
- New requests, automatic refunds and disputes notify holders of `refunds` (`refund.requested`, `refund.auto`,
  `refund.dispute`), linking to `/admin/refunds`.
- A refund made by hand on the Cashfree dashboard reaches us through the same refund webhook under Cashfree's own
  refund id, and is matched by order. Once it succeeds it is recorded on the order (so no queued refund is sent
  again), earns its credit note, closes a waiting request as approved, tells the customer (`refund.completed`) and
  `refunds` holders (`refund.auto`), and is audited `subscription.refundedOutside`. Only the whole price ends the
  pack or pass; a partial one leaves it live. A second dashboard refund on an order already refunded changes
  nothing and alerts the desk. Without a customer request it shows on the `auto` tab.
- A credit note (`CN-FY2627-000001`) is issued when a refund is confirmed paid; it cites the original invoice (`INV-FY2627-000001`, issued when the payment succeeded),
  and `/me/payments` shows both numbers. An order that was never invoiced (a failed, late or mismatched payment refunded automatically) gets no credit note.

## 6. Maker-checker / approval
- **Applicable: no.** Finance is a read-only reporting surface today - no proposal/approval
  states, no mutations, no audit writes. The one exception is the refunds desk (5.12): a customer
  asks, staff approve or reject, and both are audited. Refunds are not initiated from the finance tiles. A real backend would introduce maker-checker on refunds (see
  [`../../system/cross-cutting.md`](../../system/cross-cutting.md) section 2).

## 7. State machine
- No entity lifecycle is owned by this page. The only "states" are transaction **status**
  values surfaced from the synthetic ledger: `closed`, `pending`, `refunded`, `failed`.
  These are display categories, not transitions the
  page can drive.

## 8. Edge cases, validation & error states
- **Loading:** `<Loading />` until `getSettings()` resolves.
- **Flag-gated sections:** charts / models / transactions blocks render only when their
  `finance.*` option flag is on; the whole module is hidden when the `finance` admin flag is off.
- **Divide-by-zero guards:** `arpu` uses `max(1, users)`; `ownerSubs`/`seekerSubs` use `max(1, price)`;
  `pct()` returns `null` when `prev` is 0/undefined.
- **Empty ledger:** table shows "No transactions match." when filters exclude everything.
- **Refund sign:** refunded rows carry a negative `amount` and render red; `abs()` is used for the
  refunds/pending rollups so totals stay positive.
- **Missing fees:** every fee read has a fallback default, so a partial `settings.fees` still renders.
- **Concurrency:** shared in-memory store; values recompute on mount only (`useMemo` with static deps).

## Payment webhook: signature, raw body, idempotent, always 200

`POST /webhooks/cashfree/payment` is the source of truth for whether a purchase was actually
paid for. The synchronous 201 on a checkout only says an order was created; this is what tells
a customer they were charged. Four rules govern it, and each exists because dropping it opens a
specific hole.

1. **Signature-verified.** The route is `permitAll` because a provider has no user session;
   authenticity is an HMAC over the raw body (`WebhookSignature`). Without it, anyone who
   learned the URL could mark any order paid. `x-webhook-timestamp` is signed alongside the
   body so a captured callback cannot be replayed under a new time.
2. **Raw body, not a bound object.** The signature covers the exact bytes sent, so the body
   arrives as a `String` and is parsed here. Letting Spring bind and re-serialize would change
   key order and whitespace, and every genuine callback would fail.
3. **Idempotent.** Deduped on `data.order.order_id`, which every settling family stores under
   a unique constraint. Cashfree may redeliver, and each family's state machine refuses to move
   an order that has already settled.
4. **Always 200.** A bad signature, malformed JSON and an unknown order all return the same
   empty 200. A provider that sees an error retries forever, and a differentiated response would
   let a prober confirm which order ids are real. The one exception is deliberate: if this JVM
   cannot supply HMAC-SHA256, the verifier throws rather than reporting the sender as malformed,
   because answering 200 to a fault on *our* side would drop every payment callback for as long as
   it lasted and guarantee no retry. Unreachable on any standard JRE; the rule is stated so that
   the next reader does not "fix" it back into a 200.

The payload is nested (`data.order`, `data.payment`); the contract used to document a flat
body Cashfree has never sent, so a faithful implementation would have silently never fired.

Lives in `finance` because three unrelated families settle here: subscriptions, paid
service requests and amendments. Each side ignores an order id it does not own, so all three are always
offered the event rather than guessing from the payload which it was. Each gets its own
try/catch: a shared one meant a failure in the first path returned 200 without the others being
asked, and Cashfree does not retry a 200. A paid webhook that matches nothing (or has a handler
throw) is logged loudly and unreconciled — the two causes are distinct log lines because they
route paging to different places.

`payment_time` seeds the settlement instant for every family that settles from the
callback. Falls back to now when absent or unparseable rather than failing the
callback: the fact of the payment matters more than the exact stamp. `payment_amount` is
parsed to whole rupees for a reconciliation check against our own ledger, never to overwrite
it — reading the amount back off the callback would let the provider's rounding become our
revenue figure. The decimal ? whole-rupee conversion lives in one place; a lossy conversion
duplicated across a codebase is a reconciliation bug waiting to happen.
