---

## 1. Purpose & user problem
- **Persona:** a buyer/tenant who wants to reach the owner; the owner who wants genuine, spam-free
  leads and control over who gets their number.
- **Job-to-be-done (buyer):** "Get the owner's number / start a chat about this listing." **(owner):**
  "Only share my number with people I approve (and optionally only Verified-badge users), and manage
  every incoming request in one inbox."
- **Why it matters:** this is the conversion event of the whole product - the zero-brokerage promise
  is "connect directly with owners." The gate that protects owner privacy and lead quality is the
  **request → owner-approval + conditional reveal** model — **not** an identity wall; the
  lead inbox is the owner's CRM.

## 2. Entry points
- **Buyer side (create a request):** the property detail page - `ContactBox.jsx` ("Request number")
  and `ContactOwnerModal.jsx` ("Send enquiry"), and the sticky mobile CTA + map detail panel. Route:
  `/property/:id`.
- **Opt-in Verified-badge hand-off:** `src/components/auth/VerifyIdentityRedirect.jsx` — mounted
  **only** when an owner accepts "verified contacts only". It renders nothing of its own: it sends the
  requester to `/verify-identity`, where they photograph a document and record a live selfie for a
  reviewer. It is a badge earn, not a gate.
- **Owner side (triage leads):** dashboard Enquiries/Leads tab -
  `src/pages/consumer/dashboard/EnquiriesPanel.jsx` + `LeadSheet.jsx`, fed by
  `useDashboardData.js`. Route: `/dashboard` (owner view), `ProtectedRoute`.
- **Core logic:** `src/lib/contact.js`, `src/lib/store/listings.js` (opt-in Verified-badge helpers),
  `src/services/contactService.js`, `src/services/providers/mock/contactProvider.js`.

## 3. Actors & roles
- **Maker = buyer/tenant** (signed in at **L1** — mobile OTP; no badge needed) requests the number
  or sends an enquiry.
- **Checker = owner** approves/declines from the dashboard.
- **`isOwnerViewer`** (viewer mobile == owner mobile) always sees the full number (`status:'owner'`).
- The gate is defined once in [`../../system/cross-cutting.md`](../../system/cross-cutting.md)
  (section 3); this doc is the flow-level detail.

## 4. Entities touched
- [`contact_requests`](../../system/data-model.md) - created by the buyer, decided by the owner.
  Runtime store, key `draazyContactReq:<ownerDigits>` (shared with the HTML prototype).
- [`identity_verifications`](../../system/data-model.md) - read **only** as the opt-in Verified
  badge, and used solely by the owner "verified contacts only" path; written when a **staff reviewer
  approves** a submitted document + selfie (key `draazyIdentity:<mobile>`, `{ verified: true, … }`).
  It is **never** a prerequisite for the contact gate itself.
- [`enquiries`](../../system/data-model.md) - the owner's "Enquiries" tab is **seed-only** today
  (`src/data/enquiries.json`); the buyer contact flow does **not** create rows here (see edge cases).
- Owner privacy prefs (`dzOwnerPrefs:<mobile>`, `hideNumber`) and lead annotations
  (`leadNotes`, private note + follow-up date) are read/written on the owner side.

## 5. Business rules & logic  *(the meat)*

### The contact gate (from `src/lib/contact.js`)
Under **ADR-019 (badge-not-gate)** contact is **L1-only**: the sole floor is being signed in
(mobile-OTP). There is **no identity gate** on contacting an owner. The real "gate" is the
**request → owner-approval + conditional reveal** model, plus one narrow opt-in exception.

**Floor - signed in (L1).**
`requestContact(ownerMobile, propId)`:
- Returns `'login'` if no signed-in user (the UI prompts sign-in). This is the only hard prerequisite
  to create a request.

**Narrow exception - owner "verified contacts only" (opt-in badge, L2).**
- If, and only if, the owner has opted into `verifiedContactOnly` (`ownerVerifiedOnly(ownerMobile)`)
  **and** the requester lacks the Verified badge (`isViewerVerified` reads `draazyIdentity:<buyerDigits>`),
  `requestContact` returns `'verification_required'`.
- The UI (`ContactBox.request` / `ContactOwnerModal.request`) then mounts `VerifyIdentityRedirect`,
  which hands the requester to `/verify-identity` — **one document, one selfie, checked by a person
  on our team** — and resumes the request once the badge is issued. This is the **sole** path that
  turns a contact request into `verification_required`.
- **Not the norm:** for the vast majority of listings (no `verifiedContactOnly` pref) any signed-in
  user reaches the owner-approval step directly. Verification is a **badge, never a wall** — and no
  verification nudge precedes this value moment.
- **Asynchronous by design:** submitting is not passing. `POST /me/verification/identity` answers
  **202** and a reviewer decides later, so the resumed request may be minutes or hours away. The UI
  must not promise an instant unlock.

**Owner approval (maker-checker).**
Once past the floor (and the exception, if any), `requestContact`:
- If a request already exists for this buyer+property, returns its current `status` (idempotent).
- Otherwise unshifts a new record and returns `'pending'`:
  ```
  { id: 'c'+Date.now(), propId, buyerName, buyerMobile: <digits>, status: 'pending', requestedAt: Date.now() }
  ```
- The owner's number stays **masked** (`maskPhone` -> `+91 98xxx xxxx02`) until approved.
- If a request already exists for this buyer+property, returns its current `status` (idempotent).
- Otherwise unshifts a new record and returns `'pending'`:
  ```
  { id: 'c'+Date.now(), propId, buyerName, buyerMobile: <digits>, status: 'pending', requestedAt: Date.now() }
  ```
- The owner's number stays **masked** (`maskPhone` -> `+91 98xxx xxxx02`) until approved.

### The quota, which is a second gate and is the server's (D31b)
Being signed in gets you *to* the request; it does not get you an unlimited number of them. The free
tier is **15 owner contacts** (`settings.fees.freeContactLimit`), the three priced plans are
unlimited (`plans.unlimited_contacts`, V91), and a qualified referral adds 15 more.

- **The refusal is a response, not a pre-check.** `POST /contacts/request` returns **422
  `contact_quota_exhausted`**; `ContactBox` and `ContactOwnerModal` open `ContactsExhaustedModal` on
  that error code. They deliberately do **not** read the remaining count and skip the request — that
  was the old behaviour (`canRevealContact()` in `lib/store/contactQuota.js`, evaluated before any
  network call), and it put the limit in the place with the least reason to respect it.
- **What a contact costs.** `used` is `count(contact_requests where requester = me)`, so the price is
  paid on the transition to a new row and nothing else: a repeat press on the same listing is the
  same door and is free, a refused press is free, and an owner's approval or decline changes nothing.
- **Reading the balance.** `GET /me/entitlements` → `{ contacts: { unlimited, used, allowance,
  remaining, referralBonus }, listings: { … } }`. `allowance` and `remaining` are **`null`** when
  `unlimited` — branch on the flag, never on `remaining > 0`.

### Status model (`contactStatus`)
`'owner' | 'approved' | 'pending' | 'declined' | 'none'`:
- `owner` - viewer is the owner; full number always.
- `pending` - request created, awaiting owner; masked.
- `approved` - owner approved; number can unmask (subject to privacy pref).
- `declined` - owner declined; stays masked.
- `none` - no request yet.

### Reveal rule (`ContactBox` / `ContactOwnerModal`)
Old claim: "the server never sends the owner's number to a buyer, approved or not." User decision
2026-10-03 reversed that. The rule is:
`revealed = status === 'owner' || (status === 'approved' && ownerHidesNumber === false)`.
- **Owner's number:** an approved requester sees the owner's real mobile unless the owner has
  `users.hide_number = true`. Pending, declined, none and anonymous stay masked.
- **Requester's number:** the owner sees the approved requester's real mobile in the lead inbox and
  in the listing chat. The masked `requester.mobile` stays as the list-safe display string.

Approved listing chats now have a real-time layer: `/messages/stream` sends id-only `message`,
`read`, `delivered`, `typing` and `presence` invalidations, and clients refetch the thread. The same stream
carries a `notification` event that refreshes the bell's count (cross-cutting.md §7). Read receipts and
online/last-seen are reciprocal privacy features (`shareReadReceipts`, `shareActivityStatus`); if
either participant turns one off, that surface is hidden while delivery still records normally.

### Owner decision (`setContactStatus`)
- `setContactStatus(ownerMobile, reqId, 'approved'|'declined')` flips the stored request's `status`.
- On the dashboard, `decideContact(reqId, decision)` (in `useDashboardData.js`) sends the decision,
  toasts only once the write succeeded ("Accepted — you can chat now and see their number." /
  "Request declined."), then re-reads the inbox. Double taps are ignored while the write is in flight.
  The server audits the decision; a repeat of the same decision is a no-op 200, a different one 409,
  and a request left pending for 30 days reads as `expired` and can no longer be answered.
- `pendingContactCount(ownerMobile)` powers the owner's "waiting on you" badge.

### The enquiry variant (`ContactOwnerModal.sendEnquiry`)
- "Send enquiry" is also "contacting the owner", so like the number request it is **L1-only** (any
  signed-in user; no badge). If `inAppMessaging` is on it `queueOwnerChat(p, { firstMessage })`
  (a real chat request the owner accepts in Messages); if off it just toasts "enquiry sent". It does
  **not** create a `contact_request` or an `enquiries` row.

### Owner lead inbox (`EnquiriesPanel.jsx`)
- Aggregates several request types into one normalized **lead descriptor** and a priority queue
  (attention-first, then longest-waiting):
  - **Contact requests** (`contact_requests`) - "wants to contact you", Accept / Decline; accepting
    reveals the buyer's mobile to the owner for Call/WhatsApp.
  - **Photo requests**, **Document requests** (grouped per buyer+property; grant/decline all),
    **Flatmate requests** (accept/decline), and **Enquiries** (seed).
- **Triage math:** `waitingOnYou` = pending contacts + pending flatmates + photo reqs + pending doc
  groups; `totalLeads` = all requests + enquiries; oldest-waiting age drives an urgency chip and a
  "reply within an hour" nudge. Per-row `waitPill`: `>=24h`/`>=1h` -> hot, fresh -> "new".
- **LeadSheet.jsx:** per-lead detail with a private note and a follow-up date
  (`leadNotes` / `getLeadAnnotations` / `setLeadAnnotation`, keyed by owner mobile + stable lead id),
  plus Approve/Decline, the type's primary action, and Call/WhatsApp when a mobile is available.

### Owner-side record shape (number request)
Stored under the owner's key; each item: `{ id, propId, buyerName, buyerMobile, status, requestedAt }`.
The buyer's mobile is only surfaced to the owner for Call/WhatsApp **after** approval
(`contactMobile: r.status === 'approved' ? r.buyerMobile : undefined`).

## 6. Maker-checker / approval
- **Yes - this is a canonical maker-checker.** Maker = buyer (creates a `pending` request), Checker =
  owner (approves/declines). On approval chat unlocks, the buyer's number is shown to the owner,
  and the owner number is visible to the buyer unless hidden. On decline nothing unlocks. Reject is not resubmit-locked - a buyer's
  existing record simply returns its status. Defined once in
  [`../../system/cross-cutting.md`](../../system/cross-cutting.md) (section 2, and the contact row in
  the table in 2.4; the gate itself in section 3).

## 7. State machine
```
Contact request (per buyer+property):
  none --requestContact--> pending --owner approve--> approved --> chat unlocks
                              |
                              +--owner decline--> declined (terminal)
                              +--30 days, no decision--> expired (derived; not counted, not answerable)
  owner viewer -> always 'owner' (full number)

  Floor: sign in (L1). If the owner accepts verified contacts only AND the requester
  lacks the Verified badge, requestContact returns 'verification_required' (opt-in
  badge flow) instead of creating the request. Otherwise no verification is involved.
```
- **Terminal:** `approved` and `declined`. A re-request while a record exists returns the current
  status (no duplicate).

## 8. Edge cases, validation & error states
- **Not signed in:** `requestContact` returns `'login'`; UI toasts "sign in to request the number".
- **Owner accepts verified contacts only & requester unverified:** `'verification_required'` -> the
  opt-in Verified-badge modal (not a request). For every other owner, no verification is involved.
- **Mobile-match:** a **soft** trust signal at MVP (ADR-009a) — never blocks contact and triggers no
  re-auth/redirect; the hard `403 mobile_match_required` applies only at the deal step (L3).
- **Duplicate request:** idempotent - returns the existing status instead of creating a second row.
- **Owner viewing own listing:** always sees the full number; requests are moot.
- **Approved but owner hides number:** number stays masked; buyer routed to chat/callback.
- **Chat photos:** once a thread exists, `POST /messages/{id}/photos` lets either participant send one
  JPEG/PNG (8 MB max) with an optional caption; the server strips EXIF/GPS and applies the same
  phone/email masking to captions that text messages use.
- **Enquiries tab is seed-only:** `useDashboardData` loads `listEnquiries().slice(0, 8)` from
  `src/data/enquiries.json`; those rows are **not** owner-scoped and are **not** produced by the live
  buyer contact/enquiry flow. Real buyer intent today materialises as **contact_requests** (and chat
  requests), not `enquiries`. This is a notable gap to close server-side.
- **Cross-prototype storage:** the `draazyContactReq:<ownerDigits>` key is shared with the HTML
  prototype, so requests must stay compatible.
- **`pn:store` event:** owner-pref changes dispatch a `pn:store` CustomEvent so open tabs re-render
  without reload (a lightweight in-app pub/sub the backend would replace with push).

## 9. Identity verification hardware checklist

PENDING VERIFICATION for `/verify-identity`. Run on real hardware; emulators and mocked cameras do
not prove camera permission, liveness, or iOS playback behaviour.

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Physical laptop webcam, real face | Front/back document capture succeeds; selfie liveness completes; submission reaches the review queue |
| Android Chrome, real face | Camera permission prompt appears; rear camera is preferred for documents; selfie capture works without page zoom or stuck hover/tap state |
| iPhone Safari, real face | Start button user gesture opens inline preview; no fullscreen video takeover; selfie capture and submit complete |
| Camera permission denied | User sees the camera-denied copy and can retry after granting permission; no blank capture is submitted |
| App backgrounded mid-capture | Camera stream stops or recovers on return; user can retake without stale preview files |
| Face model fails to load / offline | Selfie guidance falls back to unavailable; submission still records `liveness=unavailable` for reviewer judgement |
| Server-chosen selfie pose | Challenge picks one pose (`left`, `right`, `smile`); selfie visibly shows that pose; reviewer must confirm it before approval |
| Review approval path | Queue images load from signed URLs; approved user gets the verified badge; owner listing badge updates |
| Rejection / revoked path | Applicant sees the in-app decision; WhatsApp decision line arrives when the identity template is configured |

## Service

Rationale relocated from `ContactService` and `ContactController` Javadoc.

### Badge-not-gate (ADR-019)
Asking for contact requires only L1 (a mobile-OTP account). The L2 Verified badge is a trust
*signal*, never a wall, with exactly one exception: an owner may opt into
`users.verified_contact_only`, and only then does a badge-less caller get
`403 verification_required`. No other code path in this slice may 403 on a missing badge. The badge
is read live from `users.verified` rather than the JWT claim, because a token minted before the
badge was earned would 403 someone who is in fact verified.

### API surface
Both `/contacts` routes are authenticated by the default-deny posture in `SecurityConfig` - the
contract's `401` is that filter-chain response, not a check in the controller. There is no
`@PreAuthorize` role guard, and that is correct rather than an oversight: the spec carries no
`x-roles` on these operations and any signed-in user may ask for contact, so a role restriction
would block the common case of an owner enquiring about somebody else's listing. Identity always
comes from `AuthPrincipal`, never from the body. `requestContact` answers `200` rather than
`201` because the contract models it as "tell me where I now stand" and a repeat call is
idempotent.

### Cross-context reads
The service reads `catalog.property` and `identity.user` repositories directly.
`package-structure.md` section 5 asks features not to import each other, but `leads` is
inherently a *join* context (it relates a listing to a user), so inverting these two reads would cost
three interfaces and two adapters for no behavioural change. A deliberate, reviewed exception,
alongside the existing `security.JwtService -> identity.user.User` precedent. The one direction
that *is* inverted is the security-critical one: `catalog` reaches this feature only through the
`common.trust.ContactGate` port.

### requestContact outcomes, in decision order
1. The caller owns the listing -> `OWNER`, and no row is written (asking yourself for your own
   number is not a lead).
2. The owner accepts verified contacts only and the caller has no badge -> `403
   verification_required`, the single legitimate badge 403.
3. Otherwise the existing request is returned unchanged, or a new `pending` one is created - and
   creating one spends an owner contact, which can run out.

**Idempotent by design.** Re-requesting returns the current state rather than inserting a second row,
so a double-tap cannot flood an owner's inbox and, more importantly, cannot reset a `declined`
request back to `pending`, which would turn "no" into a retry loop. Two genuinely concurrent taps
can both miss the read, so `uq_contact_requests_requester_property` is the real guarantee and the
loser of the race simply re-reads the winner's row.

**The quota is checked last, and only on the insert branch.** Order matters twice over. An owner
looking at their own listing never spends a contact, because outcome 1 returns before the check. A
caller re-reading a conversation they already opened never spends one either, because the
existing-row probe short-circuits: running out of contacts stops you approaching a *new* owner, it
does not close doors you already walked through. That is also what makes idempotency survive the
quota.

**The quota counts rows rather than reading a stored balance**, which is what makes it safe under
concurrency without a lock: the count and the spend are the same fact, and the unique constraint
settles a tie by failing the loser's insert. Two simultaneous requests against two *different*
listings could both pass a check at the last contact and both insert - one contact over. Accepted
knowingly: the remedy is a lock on every contact request, out of all proportion to the harm. The
refusal message names the two ways out, because a refusal that does not is a dead end.

### Owner inbox
Strictly owner-scoped: the id set comes from `properties.owner_id`, so a caller can never see a
request against someone else's listing, and an owner with no listings gets an empty array without a
second query. N+1-safe at three queries - listing ids, requests, requesters - regardless of inbox
size, and the verified badge on each party is one more query for the whole page.


`respondContactRequest` enforces owner scope by lookup, not by a check after the fact: the row is
only accepted once `properties.findByIdAndOwner_Id` confirms the caller owns the listing it points
at. A request belonging to another owner is a `404`, never a `403` - we do not confirm that
someone else's lead exists. Both end states are terminal, so an owner cannot revoke a reveal the
buyer has already seen. Approval notifies the buyer inside the same transaction; a decline stays
silent on purpose.

### Reveal policy
Old D5 claim: "An owner's raw number is never revealed to another viewer." User decision
2026-10-03 reversed it. A non-owner viewer sees the owner's raw mobile only when all three are true:
the viewer has an `approved` contact request on that listing, the listing owner is the counterparty,
and `users.hide_number` is false. Everyone else receives the masked form; owners always see their
own number. `verificationRequired` is false for the owner of the listing, whatever their own
preference says.
