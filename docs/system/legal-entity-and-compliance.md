## 1. Executive Summary

**Draazy** is a technology **marketplace / broking-services platform** (not a land-dealing
"real-estate business"), earning from **subscriptions and paid services** - explicitly
**fee-only, not holding customer funds** (a deliberate choice
that keeps you out of RBI Payment-Aggregator licensing). You handle **PII + identity-document
data** and integrate regulated seams (Razorpay, KYC aggregator, DLT SMS, WhatsApp), and are
architected to **scale to millions with a clear future-funding path**.

**Bottom line: incorporate a Private Limited Company.** It's the only structure that simultaneously
gives you limited liability, **ESOP capability**, **angel/VC investability**, **DPIIT Startup
recognition** (3-year tax holiday + abolished angel tax), and clean scalability. Every other
structure fails on at least one dimension a fundable tech startup cannot compromise on.

**Two real-estate-specific flags most advisors miss:** (a) **MahaRERA real-estate-agent
registration** likely applies to your brokerage/facilitation activity; (b) **DPDP Act** duties are
elevated because you touch government identity documents and the images of them.

## 2. Recommended Business Structure

### Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) — under the Companies Act, 2013

**Why it's the best fit for Draazy:**
- **Fundability:** Angels/VCs invest via equity/CCPS **only** into a company. Non-negotiable if you'll raise.
- **ESOP:** Grant stock options to early hires (critical when cash-constrained) — LLP/OPC effectively cannot.
- **Limited liability:** Founders' personal assets ring-fenced — important given data-breach / consumer-liability exposure.
- **DPIIT / Startup India:** Unlocks the **80-IAC 3-year tax holiday**, self-certification on labour/environment laws, easier tenders.
- **Perpetual succession + credibility:** Vendors (Razorpay, Meta, KYC aggregators) onboard companies most smoothly.
- **Tax efficiency:** Optional **22% regime (Sec 115BAA)**, or stay in the normal regime to exploit the 80-IAC holiday.

**Assumption:** you have **>=2 founders** *or* intend to raise external capital. If you are a **solo
founder who will raise later**, still go **Pvt Ltd** (not OPC) — see §3.

## 3. Comparison Table — All Entity Types

Scores out of 10 (higher = better for *your* fundable-tech-startup profile).

| Criterion | Sole Prop | Partnership | LLP | **Pvt Ltd** | OPC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setup cost (low burden) | 10 | 9 | 7 | 6 | 6 |
| Compliance burden (lighter=higher) | 10 | 8 | 7 | 4 | 5 |
| Liability protection | 1 | 1 | 8 | **10** | 9 |
| Taxation efficiency | 5 | 5 | 6 | **9** | 7 |
| Ability to raise funding | 1 | 2 | 4 | **10** | 2 |
| ESOP capability | 1 | 1 | 2 | **10** | 2 |
| Scalability | 2 | 3 | 6 | **10** | 4 |
| Investor attractiveness | 1 | 1 | 4 | **10** | 2 |
| Founder flexibility | 9 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 5 |
| DPIIT / Startup India benefits | 3 | 3 | 8 | **10** | 8 |
| **Verdict (fundable-startup lens)** | Low | Low | Medium | **★ Highest** | Medium-Low |

**Why the others are less suitable:**
- **Sole Proprietorship / Partnership** — **unlimited personal liability** (fatal given data/consumer risk); no equity, no ESOP, uninvestable. Fine only for a hobby project.
- **LLP** — good liability + lighter compliance, but **cannot issue shares or ESOPs**; **VCs/angels avoid LLPs**. A dead-end if you'll raise. Reconsider **only** if you commit to lifelong bootstrapping.
- **OPC** — limited liability for a solo founder, **but** no equity funding, no practical ESOP, capped (must convert to Pvt Ltd on crossing **₹2 Cr turnover / ₹50 L paid-up capital**), resident nominee only. You'd just convert later — so **start as Pvt Ltd**.

## 4. Registration Roadmap (Pvt Ltd via MCA SPICe+)

1. **Digital Signature Certificate (DSC)** for all directors — licensed CA (Class 3). *(1–2 days; ₹1,000–2,000/director.)*
2. **Name reservation** — MCA **SPICe+ Part A** (check trademark + MCA name availability; keep "Draazy" consistent with your TM filing). *(1–3 days.)*
3. **SPICe+ Part B (incorporation)** with linked forms:
   - **eMoA (INC-33)** + **eAoA (INC-34)** — charter documents.
   - **AGILE-PRO-S (INC-35)** — bundles **GST (optional here), EPFO, ESIC, Professional Tax (Maharashtra), bank account**.
   - **DIN** for directors auto-allotted (up to 3) within SPICe+.
4. **PAN + TAN** — auto-generated on incorporation (no separate filing).
5. **Certificate of Incorporation (COI)** issued by MCA / CRC.
6. **Post-incorporation:** open current account, deposit subscription capital, file **INC-20A (commencement)** within 180 days, appoint **first auditor** within 30 days.

**Required documents:** PAN + Aadhaar of directors; passport photos; address proof (bank
statement/utility <=2 months); **registered office proof** (rent agreement + NOC + latest utility
bill); DSC; email/mobile.

**Estimated statutory + professional cost:** **₹8,000–₹25,000** all-in (varies by state stamp duty
on MoA/AoA and authorized capital; keep authorized capital modest, e.g., ₹1–10 L). **Timeline:
~7–15 working days.**

---

## 5. Compliance Checklist

**A. Mandatory / at incorporation**
- PAN + TAN — auto with SPICe+.
- **GST registration** — **register early**; effectively required for Razorpay settlement, interstate/online service supply, and input credit. Brokerage/marketplace services = **18% GST**. (Threshold ₹20 L for services, but online/interstate nature usually forces earlier registration.)
- **Professional Tax (Maharashtra)** — **PTEC + PTRC** (AGILE-PRO-S / Maharashtra portal).
- **Shops & Establishment Act (Maharashtra)** registration for the Pune office.
- **EPFO / ESIC** — allotted at incorporation; actual compliance triggers at 20 / 10 employees respectively.

**B. Startup-specific (do these — mostly free, high ROI)**
- **Startup India registration** (free) -> **DPIIT Recognition** (free): unlocks **80-IAC tax holiday**, self-certification, tender relaxations.
- **MSME / Udyam** (free): subsidies, faster-payment protection, fee rebates (incl. **50% trademark fee**).

**C. Sector-specific (real estate — the flags not to miss)**
- ⚠️ **MahaRERA Real-Estate Agent registration** — under RERA 2016 + MahaRERA rules, agents **facilitating sale/purchase of RERA-registered projects** must register. Your brokerage/lead-facilitation likely triggers this. **Scope with a MahaRERA-savvy lawyer** before monetizing brokerage. (Rental-only facilitation is lower-risk than sale facilitation.)
- **Consumer Protection Act / e-commerce rules** — accurate listings, grievance redressal, no misleading claims.

**D. Data & IT**
- **DPDP Act, 2023** — you're a **Data Fiduciary**: consent notices, purpose limitation, **grievance officer**, breach reporting, retention limits. **Elevated** because verification is **in-house** (ADR-009/009b). Be exact about what is kept, because the answer differs by field:
  - *Never stored* — the document number itself. Only `HMAC(docType:number)` and the last four survive.
  - *Kept indefinitely* — name, date of birth, document type, the masked last four, and `person_key`, a keyed hash over name+DOB. A retention answer that stops at "a hash and the last four" omits two directly identifying fields.
  - *Purged* — the document and selfie **images**, seven days after a decision (`draazy.identity.image-retention-days`, so an operator can change the number without a code change). A case left undecided is rejected by the daily `identity-pending-expiry` job after `draazy.identity.pending-ttl` (14 days), which purges its images at once.
- **IT Act + SPDI Rules** — reasonable security practices; publish **Privacy Policy + Terms**.

**E. Not applicable / avoidable**
- **IEC (Import-Export Code)** — not needed (no cross-border goods).
- **RBI Payment-Aggregator licence** — **avoided by design** (fee-only; you never hold/settle rent funds). Keep it that way at MVP; moving funds later (Razorpay Route/escrow) shifts this to Razorpay, not you.
- ⚠️ **RBI/FEMA (FC-GPR)** — **only if you take foreign investment** later (FIRMS portal reporting).

**F. Recurring annual (Pvt Ltd)**
- ROC: **AOC-4** (financials), **MGT-7/7A** (annual return), **DIR-3 KYC**, **ADT-1** (auditor), board meetings + minutes; **statutory audit** (mandatory regardless of turnover); Income-tax return; monthly/quarterly **GST returns**; **TDS** returns.

---

## 6. Tax & Funding Analysis

### Tax
- **Corporate tax options:** **25%** (turnover <= ₹400 Cr) under normal regime **with** exemptions, **or 22% (Sec 115BAA)** without exemptions (also removes MAT). **Strategy:** if DPIIT-recognised, stay in normal regime to use the **80-IAC 100% profit deduction for 3 of first 10 years**, then evaluate 115BAA.
- **Angel tax:** **Abolished for all investors from FY 2024-25** (Finance Act 2024 scrapped Sec 56(2)(viib)) — major de-risking for future raises. DPIIT recognition still valuable for the tax holiday.
- **GST:** Output **18%** on subscriptions, service fees and platform/brokerage fees; **claim input credit** on Razorpay fees, cloud (DigitalOcean/Cloudflare - note reverse-charge on some foreign SaaS), SMS/WhatsApp vendors. Watch **TDS you must deduct:** **194-H** (commission), **194-I/194-IB** (rent), **194-J** (professional fees).
- **Entity comparison:** Pvt Ltd's **22–25%** (with holiday -> effectively lower early) beats Partnership/LLP's flat **30% + surcharge/cess**; Sole Prop taxed at individual slabs (up to 30%) with unlimited liability. **Pvt Ltd wins on rate and reliefs.**

### Funding readiness

| Path | Fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bootstrapping** | Now | The $0 free-tier architecture is *built* for this. |
| **Angel** | High (Pvt Ltd) | Equity/CCPS; DPIIT + no-angel-tax help; SAFE/CCPS common. |
| **Venture Capital** | High (Pvt Ltd) | VCs fund **only companies**; ESOP pool expected. |
| **Foreign investment** | Allowed (with care) | **FDI permitted in real-estate broking/marketplace services** under the automatic route; **prohibited in "real estate business"** (dealing in land/buildings). Your model is broking/marketplace -> allowed. File **FC-GPR** on FIRMS within 30 days of allotment. |

**Investor-ideal structure:** **Pvt Ltd** with a clean cap table, an **ESOP pool (10–15%)**, and DPIIT recognition.

## 7. Intellectual Property Strategy

| IP | Register? | What / Class | Indicative cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trademark** ("Draazy" wordmark + logo) | **Yes, priority** | File **TM-A**, **Class 36** (real-estate/financial services) + **Class 42** (SaaS/tech); consider **Class 35** (online marketplace/advertising) | **₹4,500/class** govt (startup/MSME rate) + professional ₹3–8k. **Udyam gets the reduced fee.** |
| **Copyright** (source code, UI, content) | Optional | Auto-protected on creation; register for stronger evidentiary proof (Form XIV) | ₹500–2,000 govt + professional |
| **Patent** | Usually skip | Software "per se" isn't patentable in India absent a technical effect; not worth it now | — |
| **Domains** | Yes | Defensively register **draazy.com/.in/.co.in** + variants | ₹1–2k/yr each |

**Do first:** clear the **"Draazy" trademark search *before* finalizing the MCA name** so the
company name and brand don't diverge.

---

## 8. Estimated Costs (Indicative)

**One-time**
- Incorporation (govt + professional): **₹8,000–₹25,000**
- DSCs (per director): **₹1,000–₹2,000**
- Trademark (2 classes, w/ Udyam rate + professional): **₹12,000–₹22,000**
- Startup India + DPIIT + Udyam: **₹0** (professional help optional ₹3–8k)
- Domains: **₹3,000–₹6,000**
- **Total one-time: ~₹30,000–₹60,000**

**Annual (recurring)**
- Statutory audit + accounting + ROC/IT/GST filings (small startup): **₹25,000–₹70,000/yr**
- Professional Tax, DSC renewals, misc: **₹5,000–₹15,000/yr**
- MahaRERA agent registration (if applicable): **~₹10,000–₹25,000** — confirm current MahaRERA fee.
- **Total annual: ~₹35,000–₹1,00,000/yr** (scales with headcount/turnover)

---

## 9. Action Plan — Next 30 Days

**Week 1**
1. **Trademark availability search** for "Draazy" (Class 36/42/35) — lock the brand before the MCA name.
2. Decide cap table + **founder shareholding + ESOP pool (~10–15%)**; draft a simple **Founders' Agreement**.
3. Engage a **CA/CS** (many offer a fixed-fee incorporation package).

**Week 2**
4. Obtain **DSCs**; file **SPICe+ Part A** (name reservation).
5. Prepare registered-office proof (rent + NOC + utility) and director KYC docs.

**Week 3**
6. File **SPICe+ Part B + INC-33/34 + AGILE-PRO-S** (GST/PT/EPFO/ESIC/bank). Receive **COI + PAN + TAN**.
7. **File the trademark (TM-A).**

**Week 4**
8. Open **current account**; deposit subscription capital; file **INC-20A**; **appoint first auditor (ADT-1)**.
9. Apply **Startup India -> DPIIT recognition** and **Udyam/MSME** (free).
10. **Legal scoping call on MahaRERA + DPDP**; draft **Privacy Policy + Terms** for the app.

---

## 10. Final Recommendation

**Incorporate Draazy as a Private Limited Company now**, and immediately layer on **DPIIT
recognition + Udyam** (free, high-value) and the **"Draazy" trademark**. This structure is the
**only** one that keeps every future door open — angel/VC funding, ESOPs for early hires, limited
liability against your data/consumer risk, and the 80-IAC tax holiday — while your **fee-only,
seam-based architecture already sidesteps the heaviest regulatory burden (RBI payment-aggregator
licensing).**

The **two sector-specific items to action deliberately** — because they're where real-estate
startups get caught — are **MahaRERA agent registration** (scope it before monetizing brokerage) and
**DPDP compliance** (elevated because identity verification is in-house). The number itself is
already handled exactly right: hashed, never stored. The two open items are the identifying fields
the row *does* keep indefinitely — name, DOB and `person_key` — and the images on a case nobody ever
decided, which no sweep collects. See §D.

**Scenario notes / assumptions made:**
- *If solo founder:* still **Pvt Ltd** (not OPC) if you'll ever raise or grant ESOPs.
- *If you truly will never raise and want minimal compliance:* **LLP** is the only defensible alternative — but you forfeit ESOPs and investability.
- *If foreign co-founder/investor from day one:* Pvt Ltd + plan **FEMA/FC-GPR** reporting; confirm the broking-vs-real-estate-business FDI distinction with counsel.

## 11. DPDP erasure — what is deleted, what is retained, and on whose authority

*Home of the reasoning behind `identity.user.erasure.ErasureRetention`. That class holds no behaviour
worth speaking of; it exists because the hard part of a right-to-erasure implementation is not the
`UPDATE` statements but the decision about which data a statute forbids you to erase, and that decision
is invisible in the code that acts on it. A reader can reconstruct **what** `ErasureService` does by
reading it. They cannot reconstruct **why** a rent agreement survives an erasure request and a KYC
record does not, and getting that wrong in either direction is a legal failure: erase too much and the
platform destroys evidence it is required to hold; erase too little and it has not honoured a statutory
right.*

### The governing rule

Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (India):

- **s.12(3)** — a Data Principal has the right to erasure of their personal data.
- **s.8(7)** — the Data Fiduciary *shall* erase on withdrawal of consent or once the purpose is served,
  *"unless retention is necessary for compliance with any law for the time being in force"*.

So the question for every category is not "is this personal?" — most of it is — but "does another
statute require us to keep being able to identify this person in this record?" Where the answer is yes,
retention is not a concession the platform grants itself; it is a competing legal duty, and the record
says which one.

### Two further principles that decided the harder cases

1. **A record with two subjects has two sets of rights.** A rent agreement, a closed deal and a review
   are each a statement involving somebody who is not the person asking to be erased. One party's
   erasure right does not reach into the other party's evidence of a transaction they were also part
   of. This is why a rent agreement is retained even though it names the erasing subject — the
   counterparty's ability to prove the tenancy is not the subject's to extinguish.
2. **Pseudonymisation of the identity root de-identifies the graph.** Fifty-five tables carry a
   `user_id` foreign key into `users`. Almost none holds contact data of its own — they hold a
   reference. Once the `users` row no longer names a person, those references point at nobody, which is
   what "irreversibly pseudonymised" means in practice. That is why erasure is a small, explicit sweep
   of the tables that duplicate identity rather than a cascade over everything mentioning the id. A
   cascade would delete the retained categories and could not be undone.

### Why the reasons are stored, not only coded

`ErasureRetention.retainedWithReasons()` is written into `erasure_requests.retained` at execution, so a
request decided today still carries the reasoning it was decided under after that class has been edited.
A retention record whose justification is "whatever the current code says" is not a record of a
decision. The map is ordered so the stored document reads the same way every time and a diff between two
requests is a real diff. The per-category statutory citations live in that method's strings — they are
the disclosure itself, not commentary on it.

### Known gaps are disclosed, not hidden

`ErasureRetention.knownGaps()` lists personal data this sweep does not reach, and is written into the
stored request beside the retained categories: an erasure that quietly misses a table is worse than one
that says it missed it, because the subject is told they were erased and the data is still there. Each
entry is a place where the platform duplicates identity outside the `users` row, so pseudonymising the
identity root does *not* de-identify it. They are gaps rather than retentions — no statute requires any
of them and each should be swept — and they are listed rather than swept because each needs its exact
columns confirmed against the schema first, and a sweep that names a column wrongly fails at runtime on
the one operation that must not fail halfway. Most of the list was **not** found by reading the code: it
is derived from the migrated schema by `ErasureCoverageTest`, which classifies every personal-data
column in `information_schema` and fails the build on any that is neither swept nor listed. Until that
test existed, eight tables carrying live contact details were disclosed to nobody. Anything added to
that list has to be a real disclosure, because the subject reads it.

### How `ErasureCoverageTest` decides what counts as personal data

Nothing in the schema marks a column as personal, so the set is derived from column names, and the
derivation is deliberately **conservative — it must over-match, never under-match**. A false positive
(`cities.name`, `localities.lat`, `plans.contact_limit`) costs one line in the test's `RETAINED`
map saying why it is not personal, written once, by someone who had to look. A false negative costs a
column of live personal data that erasure silently misses and no test ever mentions again. So the
vocabulary is matched as a bare substring: `name` matches `tenant_name`, `society_name` and
`plans.name` alike, and every match must be classified whether or not it turns out to be
personal. The only concession is a short list of tokens (`pan`, `gst`, `ip`, `age`, `lat`, `lng`,
`dob`) matched on underscore boundaries instead, because `contains("ip")` matches `description`,
`recipient` and `script` and would turn the classification maps into a transcription of the whole
schema that nobody would read. The heuristic is a tripwire for *new* tables, not an inventory of the
existing one: the test's `ERASED` map deliberately lists columns the vocabulary does not match
(`tenant_profiles.prior_landlord`, `identity_verifications.identity_hash`) so the behavioural check
covers the whole sweep rather than only the part a regex found.

### The four ways a column stops carrying personal data

`CLEARED` reads back null (or false for a NOT NULL boolean). `REPLACED` keeps a value that is no
longer the subject's — `users.mobile` is NOT NULL, so substitution is
the only option the schema leaves. `ROW_REMOVED` deletes the whole row. `DETACHED` keeps the row and
nulls its link to the subject, and is separate from the other two for a reason in each direction:
it cannot be `CLEARED` because the nulled column is also the only way to find the row, so a read-back
would look up a key that no longer exists and report the fixture broken; and it must not be
`ROW_REMOVED` because this classification is read by people auditing what the company still holds,
and recording that page views were deleted when they were kept would be a false statement about
retained data in a document whose whole purpose is that its statements are true. `DETACHED`
therefore additionally proves the rows *survived* — the half `ROW_REMOVED` would have had backwards.
`page_views.user_id` is the case: the view is already counted in a daily aggregate naming nobody, so
deleting the row would falsify settled traffic history to erase an identity that nulling removes just
as completely.

### Decisions worth reading twice

- **`tenant_rentals` goes whole.** `address` is NOT NULL so nulling is unavailable, but the real
  reason is that the rest of the row — rent, lease window — describes one tenancy closely enough to
  identify it, so half-erasing would leave the more revealing half behind. The table used to hold a
  free-text `landlord_name` as well: a third party's data with no foreign key, so the named landlord
  could never be found to erase it. V57 dropped the column rather than leave that gap (ledger 285).
- **`managed_property_rent_receipts` runs the same asymmetry from the other side.** The party erasing
  is normally the landlord, and the claim destroyed would be the tenant's. The three retained columns
  are not incidental to the document, they *are* the document: a receipt that does not say who paid
  whom for which address proves nothing. `tenant_name` and `landlord_name` are again free text with
  no foreign key, and are kept deliberately because the receipt needs them, so the limitation is
  disclosed rather than silent.
- **`outbound_message` goes whole** because the column that matched the vocabulary is not the hard
  one: `body` holds the rendered message, and a row with a nulled mobile and an intact "Hi Ramesh,
  about your flat in Kothrud" is not erased in any sense a subject would accept.
- **Society claims and residents are not swept: they no longer exist.** V94 emptied those tables when
  the society community features were retired, and the contract migration drops them.
- **`identity_verifications.identity_hash` is cleared** precisely because it is the part most easily
  argued into staying: it is the irreversible "one document, one account" dedup key, and keeping it
  would let the platform recognise the same human on their return — the exact capability erasure
  removes.
- **`service_request_parties.mobile` is `ROW_REMOVED` because the schema leaves no third option.** A
  pending row carries the mobile *instead of* a user id under a CHECK that exactly one is set, so
  blanking it violates the constraint and filling in a user id would bind an agreement to the account
  being erased. Claimed rows hold no mobile at all and are out of scope by construction.
- **`flatmate_groups.lat/lng` are retained** on the same footing as `societies.lat/lng`, with one
  difference worth naming: a group is created by a member, so the question is real rather than
  rhetorical. The group outlives the member — erasing one person should not move a flat off the map
  for everyone still living in it, and the group row de-identifies with the `users` row anyway.


## 12. DPDP data export — the redaction rule for shared records

`DataExportScope` is to `DataExportService` what `ErasureRetention` is to `ErasureService`: the
decision, held apart from the SQL. It exists because the hard part of a right-to-access
implementation is not the `SELECT` statements — it is deciding which rows are the subject's to see.

**Governing rule.** Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (India), **s.11(1)** grants the Data
Principal a summary of personal data processed about them, the processing activities, and every
sharee. **s.11(2)** is the limit: no disclosure that would *"reveal the identity of any other Data
Principal"*. The redaction rule below is that limit, applied uniformly.

### Where the scope comes from

Every table below was taken from the erasure coverage map, not enumerated afresh.
`ErasureCoverageTest` classifies every personal-data column as swept, retained, or a disclosed gap;
those three maps together *are* the platform's inventory of personal data, and they are already
proved against `information_schema`. `DataExportCoverageTest` fails the build if a table named in
`ErasureRetention.knownGaps()` is neither exported nor explicitly excluded in `DataExportScope`.

The principle behind that coupling: if the platform is willing to destroy a table's rows on the
subject's say-so, it cannot claim those rows are none of the subject's business. The erasure gaps
matter *most* — that is where personal data survives an erasure request — so `saved_searches.mobile`,
`flatmate_group_members.name`, `city_waitlist`, `deal_parties`,
`personal_documents`, `flatmate_seeker_posts` and the referral tables all ship in the export.

### The redaction rule (applied uniformly to every shared record)

1. **The record is the subject's.** That it happened, when, its status, its money, and the property
   it concerns are exported in full — as much the subject's history as the counterparty's.
2. **The subject's own contribution is exported in full**, including free text in which they named
   somebody else (`tenant_profiles.prior_landlord`, `managed_properties.tenant_name`/`tenant_mobile`). They typed it,
   they can already read it in the product, and returning it discloses nothing new.
3. **The counterparty is reduced to `partyRef`** (see `DataExportRedaction`). Stable across this
   subject's exports; meaningless outside them because the digest is salted with the subject's own id.
4. **The counterparty's own contribution is exported only where the product already shows it to the
   subject** — a message in their chat thread, an enquiry note they received, the name on a referral
   they made. Hiding these would leave a worse record of the correspondence than the inbox it came
   from.
5. **The counterparty's contact details, government identifiers, documents, KYC and verification
   state are never exported, in any dataset, under any framing.** This is why `deals.counterparty_mobile`
   appears only when the subject *is* the counterparty, and why `rent_agreements` is two datasets.

**Mechanical form of the rule (what the test actually checks).** No query in `DataExportScope`
reads a second person's `users` row. `users` appears exactly once in the whole scope, in the
`account` dataset, keyed on `id = :subjectId`. Every other reference to another person routes
through `party_ref_src` or is omitted from the select list. Stating the rule as "no second-person
`users` join" makes it checkable by reading SQL rather than by trusting a paragraph.

### The staff rule

Free text a staff member wrote about the subject is not exported, and the staff member is never
named. Covers `users.flag_reason`, `properties.flag_reason` and `archive_reason`, `internal_notes`,
`ticket_notes`, `property_reviews`, and the `decided_by` / `recorded_by` / `assignee_id` /
`handled_by` columns. The load-bearing reason: a moderator's assessment is a statement by an
identifiable employee, and a fraud investigation that hands its subject the investigator's notes is
not an investigation. The sole deliberate exception is `erasure_requests.decision_note`, which
`GET /me/erasure` already returns to the subject.

### Named columns, not `SELECT *`

Every query names its columns. A named-column `SELECT` is the form in which a reviewer can see
exactly what leaves the building, and it is the only form under which a migration adding a column
cannot silently start exporting it. `select *` on `deals` would have begun disclosing
`counterparty_mobile` to landlords the day V11 shipped, with no diff anywhere to notice.

### Decisions worth reading twice (export)

- **`PARTY_REF_SOURCE` alias, not per-column.** Hashing is a property of the alias rather than the
  column, so a wrong guess about `offer_history.by` / `service_request_timeline.by` (both `text`,
  schema does not say if they hold a user id, a staff email or a display name) costs an unhelpfully
  opaque field rather than a disclosure.
- **`property_reviews.target_id` is polymorphic.** For most reviews it is a property/locality/society
  id; for `target_type = 'owner'` it is a *person's* id. Selecting it raw would have handed back the
  reviewed person's primary key — the identifier the whole redaction rule exists to keep out —
  through a column whose name gives no hint. So it is split: personal case routes through
  `party_ref_src`; impersonal keeps the real id. Discriminator is `'owner'` (V7 CHECK), not
  `'user'` — the neighbouring `reports` table uses `'user'` for the same concept, and a wrong value
  compiles, runs, returns rows, and redacts nothing (a `CASE` whose condition is never true just
  passes the id through).
- **`reports_written` is redacted even though the subject knows who they reported.** Uniformity is
  the point: the moment redaction has an "unless they already know" branch, every future dataset
  has to be argued individually, and one argument will eventually be wrong. Also, "already knows
  the person" is not the same as "should be handed their primary key in a file" — the id is a
  durable global identifier the product never shows, and it is exactly what would let two exports
  be joined.
- **Withheld list is serialised into every response.** Same reasoning as `ErasureRetention.knownGaps()`:
  a document that quietly omits a category is worse than one that names it. The subject can then ask
  about it specifically. `reports` about the subject and `service_request_identities` are excluded
  because no redaction is safe. `audit_log` is excluded because it is a record of what staff did,
  indexed by the subject rather than about them.
- **The redaction rule ships in the response payload**, not only in API docs. Two datasets return a
  record with the other side removed, and a reader who does not know that is entitled to conclude
  the platform holds nothing more. Putting the statement in the payload means it travels with the
  data.
