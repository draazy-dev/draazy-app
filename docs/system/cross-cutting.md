# Cross-cutting Patterns

This is the foundation document for Draazy. It defines the patterns that are reused across
every feature so that individual flow docs can link here instead of re-explaining them. Whenever
a flow doc mentions auth, an approval/verification step, the contact gate, soft-delete,
audit, pagination, the provider seam, or notifications, it points back to the relevant section
below.

Two hard truths frame everything here (see [`./platform-architecture.md`](./platform-architecture.md)):

- **The mock layer is the business logic today.** All of the rules below are currently enforced
  in browser JavaScript over `localStorage`. Every rule marked "MUST be server-enforced" is a
  trust boundary that a real backend has to own.
- **There is no real security yet.** Route guards, roles, and gates are UX conveniences backed by
  editable `localStorage`. They shape the experience; they do not protect data.

Related docs:
- [`./data-model.md`](./data-model.md) - ER map + persistence design (field shapes → OpenAPI schemas).
- [`OpenAPI spec`](../../backend/src/main/resources/static/openapi/draazy-api.yaml) - the REST API contract the future backend must expose.
- [`./platform-architecture.md`](./platform-architecture.md) - overall system shape and the provider seam.

## 1. Auth and roles

### Roles

The session user carries a `role`. The **canonical auth roles are defined by the `Role` schema in the
[OpenAPI spec](../../backend/src/main/resources/static/openapi/draazy-api.yaml)**: `buyer`,
`owner`, `staff`, `admin`. This section only explains how they behave; it does not redefine the enum.

- `buyer` - property seekers (the default; also covers tenants — "Buyer / Tenant").
- `owner` - property owners / landlords.
- `admin` - platform super-admin; bypasses team scoping and module scoping.
- `manager` - back-office lead below the single admin; bypasses team scoping, opens only modules allowed
  by its permission atoms, and can create/manage staff accounts only.
- `staff` - internal ops team member, scoped to one or more `teams` (`rental`, `legal`, `interior`,
  `packers`, `valuation` — the `Team` schema in the spec).

`isInternal(user)` (in `src/lib/auth.js`) treats `admin`, `manager`, and `staff` as back-office.

### Session storage and the two login doors

Session state lives in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` under the keys `draazyUser` (the cached
profile) and `draazyTokens` (the 15-minute access token), managed by `src/lib/auth.js`:

- `writeUser(user, remember)` - persists to `localStorage` when "remember this device" is on,
  otherwise `sessionStorage` (tab-scoped). Exactly one tier holds the session at a time.
- `writeTokens(tokens, remember)` / `readAccessToken()` - the same two-tier plumbing for the access
  token. `sessionRemembered()` reports whether the session was meant to outlive the browser, so a
  refresh can restate `remember` to the server and the cookie stays scoped to match. It reads the
  server's session-hint cookie whenever that is readable, and falls back to the tokens' own storage
  tier only when it is not (the sibling-subdomain topology in §5.7.1). The ordering is the wrong way
  round from the obvious one, deliberately: the tier records where the last write *landed*, not what
  the user *asked for*, and `persistTokens` breaks the equivalence on purpose by demoting to the
  tab-scoped tier when `localStorage` is unwritable while keeping the 30-day cookie. Read the tier
  back as the choice and one transient `QuotaExceededError` becomes permanent - the next rotation
  says "not remembered", the server swaps the 30-day cookie for a session one and rewrites the hint
  to `0`, and the record of the choice is gone from both places. The hint has neither failure mode:
  it is the server's own record of what it was told, and being server-set it survives the ITP wipe
  that destroys the tier evidence entirely. Where the rotated token may actually be written stays a
  separate question, asked at the write by `localStorageWritable()`.
- `logoutUser()` clears both keys from both tiers, and expires the session-hint cookie. That last
  part is not redundant with the server's own clear on `/auth/logout`: that call is best-effort, so
  a sign-out on a flaky connection would otherwise leave a hint beside an unrevoked refresh cookie
  and the next cold boot would sign the user back in.

The rotating refresh token is deliberately absent from all of this: the server sets it as an
`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` cookie named `__Host-draazy_rt` at path `/`, so it is unreadable
from JavaScript. `services/http.js` sends every request with `credentials: 'include'`.
Clearing it is the server's job, on `POST /auth/logout`.

The path is `/` rather than the narrower `/api/auth` it once was, and the trade is deliberate. Path
scoping only ever defended against *our own* code forwarding or logging a request that carried the
cookie, and nothing in this backend logs cookies or headers. The `__Host-` prefix defends against
something we cannot otherwise stop: a browser refuses to store a cookie of that name unless it is
`Secure`, has no `Domain` and sits at `Path=/`, which is the only mechanism that makes host-only
scoping *enforced* rather than merely intended. Without it, any other host under the registrable
domain - a marketing subdomain, a third-party SaaS on a CNAME, anything a dangling DNS record can be
claimed by - can put a `Domain=.draazy.in` cookie of the same name in the jar, and neither our
clear nor the client's can remove it. That is session fixation: the victim's next cold boot restores
the *attacker's* session. Giving up path scoping to buy that is a bargain.

Both cookies are named for the deployment they are in: `secure=true` (production) gets the
`__Host-` prefix, `secure=false` (dev and e2e, plain HTTP) gets the bare names, because a browser
would reject a prefixed cookie without `Secure` outright. Nothing hardcodes either spelling -
`RefreshCookie.name()` and `RefreshCookie.hintName()` are the only source, and
`RefreshCookieNamingTest` pins both shapes so the production one is not left untested by the
profile every suite happens to run on.

A second cookie rides beside it and is deliberately **not** `HttpOnly`: `__Host-draazy_session`
(path `/`, value `1` for a remembered session and `0` for a tab-scoped one, same lifetime, `Secure`
and `SameSite` as the refresh cookie). Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention evicts
script-writable storage - `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB, `document.cookie` writes -
after seven days without first-party interaction, but leaves server-set cookies alone. So a user who
asked to be remembered for 30 days arrived on day eight with empty storage and a perfectly good
refresh cookie that nothing would ever spend, because an absent access token reads as "signed out"
everywhere else in the client. The hint is what tells "signed out" apart from "storage was cleared
underneath a live session", and it is why the cold boot spends exactly one `/auth/refresh` for the
users who have something to recover and nothing for the anonymous majority. Its value carries the
second bit because `remember` has to be restated on every rotation - the browser says nothing about
the lifetime of the cookie it presents - and the state that used to answer that question is exactly
the state ITP destroys. It carries no identity and no secret: an XSS that reads it learns only what
a bare `POST /auth/refresh` would already have told it. Both `POST /auth/logout` and every 401 from
`POST /auth/refresh` clear it, so a revoked session converges instead of retrying forever.

Because the hint is meant to be *read by the page*, and `document.cookie` is scoped by host while
`__Host-` forbids the `Domain` attribute that would widen it, the hint only reaches a UI served from
the API's own host. That makes the two supported deployment topologies unequal: behind a path proxy
(one origin serving the app and forwarding `/api`) everything works, whereas on sibling subdomains
(`www.` calling `api.`) the refresh cookie is still delivered - `SameSite=Lax` cares about site, not
origin - but the hint is invisible and the ITP recovery is silently inert. `CookieDeliveryCheck`
refuses to boot on a genuinely cross-*site* UI and logs a warning naming this second case, because a
feature that is dead only in production is exactly the failure mode that class exists to end. The
repair is the path proxy, never a `Domain` on the hint - that would reopen the shadowing above.

The writers are the auth provider, not this module: `loginUser`/`staffLoginUser` lived here while
the app was localStorage-backed and are gone. `services/providers/http/authProvider.js` calls
`writeUser` with whatever `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/staff-login` or `GET /auth/me` returned.

`src/context/AuthContext.jsx` exposes this to React via `useAuth()`, returning
`{ user, isIn, role, team, login, register, staffLogin, logout, update }`.

There are two separate login doors, wired into the route guards:

- **Consumer `/signin`** - buyers and owners. Unauthenticated access to a protected consumer
  route redirects here with a `?next=` return path.
- **Back-office `/staff-login`** - admin, manager and staff. Role and team guards redirect here.

### Route guards

All guards live in `src/components/RouteGuards.jsx` and are wired in `src/App.jsx`. They shape the
UI; they are **not** the control. Every guarded API route carries `@PreAuthorize` over the same
permission atom, so a hand-edited client reaches a 403 rather than data.

| Guard | Rule | Redirect on failure |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| `ProtectedRoute` | requires a signed-in user (`isIn`) | `/signin?next=<path>` |
| `RoleRoute roles={[...]}` | `user.role` must be in the allowed list | `/staff-login` (configurable via `redirect`) |
| `ModuleRoute moduleKey="x"` | `canAccessModule(user, x)` - a set test against `user.permissions` from `GET /me` | `/admin` |
| `FlagRoute flag="x"` | admin tab feature flag enabled | `/admin` |
| `AppFlagRoute flag="x"` | consumer feature flag enabled | `/` |

Examples in `src/App.jsx`: the admin console is `RoleRoute roles={['manager', 'admin']}`; consumer-only
pages (`/saved`, `/schedule-visit`, `/pay-rent`, ...) are `ProtectedRoute`, some nested inside
`AppFlagRoute`.

**`manager` is real again after D209.** D209 removed a dead console label that granted nothing; Phase 2
adds a schema role with hierarchy `admin > manager > staff`. Managers can load the admin shell and
open modules only when the server returns the needed atom. Admin-only routes still use
`hasRole('ADMIN')`; staff/admin guards admit managers through the Spring role hierarchy. When managers
create or change staff accounts, the existing in-app `Notifier` writes a notification to the admin.

**`TeamRoute` is gone.** It gated the five per-team ops desks (`/ops/rent-agreement`, `/ops/legal`,
`/ops/interior`, `/ops/packers`, `/ops/valuation`) on `x ∈ teams[]` and redirected to
`/ops?denied=x`. Those desks were retired — they read `localStorage` while the work had moved to
Postgres — and the routes now redirect into `/ops/drafting-desk?type=x`. Dropping the guard widened
nothing: `ServiceDeskAuthority.deskFilterFor` scopes a staff caller to their own desk and ignores a
`team` they do not own (D44), so the server was always the thing holding the line and the guard only
chose the error message. What replaced its *user-visible* role is the desk picker, which offers a
staffer their own desk and nothing else — an empty queue and a forbidden queue must not look alike.

> **MUST be server-enforced later.** Every guard above is cosmetic. The future backend must
> authenticate via Bearer JWT (see the [OpenAPI spec](../../backend/src/main/resources/static/openapi/draazy-api.yaml)) and authorize every
> request by role and team server-side. The client role/team is a hint, never a grant.

### Where a permission atom shares a guard

`PATCH /societies/{slug}/residents/{id}` admits staff only with `societies:write`; the committee
member path remains a separate society-ownership guard because residents hold no back-office atoms.

The reason is that the endpoint has two legitimate callers with nothing in common. One is an ops
account working the residency queue, which is what the atom describes. The other is a **committee
member of that society** approving a neighbour's residency claim — a resident, holding no
back-office permissions at all, who would fail any atom check by construction.

## 2. Maker-checker / approval pattern (defined once here)

**This is the canonical definition. All flow docs reference this section instead of restating it.**

Many Draazy features share one shape: one party *proposes* a change, and a second party
*approves or rejects* it before it takes effect. This is the maker-checker (proposer-approver)
pattern. Documenting it once keeps every approval flow consistent.

### 2.1 Generic model

- **Maker** proposes an action (create a listing, request contact, request finalization, request
  a document). The proposal is recorded but has no side effect yet.
- **Checker** reviews the proposal and either **approves** (the side effects fire) or **rejects**
  (no side effects; the maker may fix and resubmit).
- Every proposal is a persisted record with a `status`, timestamps, and enough identity to know
  who the maker is. Approval writes an **audit trail** (see section 4).

### 2.2 Canonical state machine

```
draft/submitted  ->  pending  ->  approved  ->  [side-effects fire]
                          |
                          +--->  rejected  ->  [maker fixes, resubmits -> pending]
```

- **draft / submitted** - maker is preparing or has just proposed.
- **pending** - awaiting the checker. Terminal only if abandoned/cancelled by the maker.
- **approved** - checker accepted; side-effects apply and an audit entry is written.
- **rejected** - checker declined, usually with a reason; the maker can address it and resubmit,
  which returns the record to **pending**.

Intermediate states exist in some flows (for example the verification review adds `in_review` and
`clarification` between submitted and decided). They are refinements of "pending", not new
top-level stages.

### 2.3 Canonical example in real code: property verification

Grounded in `moderation.verification.PropertyVerificationService` / `ApprovalGate` and
`src/pages/admin/AdminProperties.jsx`. Full contract:
[`../flows/admin/property-verification.md`](../flows/admin/property-verification.md) §5–§7.

- **Maker = owner.** Creating a listing stamps `status: 'pending'`. The listing is not live.
- **Checker = staff or admin**, never the listing's owner (`ApprovalGate`, every approve path,
  bulk included).
- **Checklist.** Three facts — photos real, not a duplicate, details and location right — each
  ticked by the checker; approve refuses `409 checklist_incomplete` until all three are ticked. An
  edit that sends the listing back to `pending` unticks them.
- **Decision.** `approve | needs_info | reject`, one server transaction with the listing status,
  guarded by `expectedStatus` (`409 stale_decision`). `needs_info` and `reject` need a reason code;
  reject is final. A duplicate or hard broker signal needs a second staff member through the
  override request (`second_approver_required`).
- **Audit.** Every decision, checklist tick and override writes an `audit_log` row (section 4).

### 2.4 The same pattern in other contexts

| Context | Maker (proposes) | Checker (approves/rejects) | Approval side-effect | Code |
|---------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------|
| Listing verification | owner submits listing | staff/admin, never the owner; a second staff member for a flagged override | listing `status -> approved`, goes live | `moderation.verification.PropertyVerificationService` |
| Deal finalization | buyer requests finalize | owner accepts/declines | accept closes the deal (`closeDeal`) and auto-declines the other pending requests for that property | `src/lib/store/deals.js` `requestFinalize` / `acceptFinalize` / `declineFinalize` |
| Contact reveal | buyer requests contact | owner approves/declines | owner phone unmasks for that buyer (subject to owner privacy prefs) | `src/lib/contact.js` `requestContact` / `setContactStatus` |
| Document access | buyer requests a doc category | owner grants/declines | on grant, matching uploaded docs are shared (`sharedDocIds`) | `src/lib/data/documents.js` `addDocRequest` / `respondDocRequest` |
| Visit request | buyer requests a visit slot | owner confirms/cancels | slot confirmed | see `visitProvider` / `PATCH /visit-requests/:id/status` |
| Offer / negotiation | buyer submits an offer | owner responds (accept/counter/decline) | accepted offer feeds finalization | `src/lib/store/deals.js` `addOffer` / `respondOffer` |
| Society claim | resident claims a society role | admin moderates | claim approved | `src/pages/admin/societies/ClaimsTab.jsx` |
| Identity badge (earned) | user submits document + selfie | identity reviewer (`identity:write`), never the subject | `users.verified = true`, listings back-filled; revocable with reason | `identity.verification.IdentityReviewService` |

In every row the record starts `pending`, is decided by the checker, and only then does the
side-effect fire. Reject-then-resubmit returns the record to `pending`.

The hand-granted Verified badge is not maker-checker: with one administrator a second approval could
never complete, so a manager or the admin grants it in one step with a reason, audited as `user.badge`.

> **MUST be server-enforced later.** Today the maker and checker operate on the same editable
> `localStorage`. The backend must (a) verify the maker's identity, (b) verify the checker is
> authorized for that entity (owner of the listing, admin for verification), (c) apply the
> side-effect transactionally, and (d) write the audit entry. The client must never be trusted to
> flip a `status` to `approved` on its own.

### 2.5 Foundation edits: which edits earn re-review, and at what price

`ListingEditRules` decides; `ListingService` acts on the answer. The split is along a real seam —
everything in the rules class *decides* and nothing *acts* — which is what stops the moderator path
(`updateAsModerator`, which deliberately reacts to nothing) drifting into the owner rule.

**What counts as a foundation field.** Exactly the set a buyer can *search on*: `price`, `bhk`,
`propertyType`, `locality`, `deal`, `furnishing` and `possession` — one per facet accepted by
`GET /properties`. Re-moderation exists to stop bait-and-switch, and bait-and-switch is specifically
the act of being approved into one set of search results and then editing your way into a different,
more valuable one. Any facet an owner can change without review is a hole of exactly that shape, so
deriving the rule from the facet list rather than curating it by hand keeps the two in step: a new
facet that is not also a foundation field is a new hole, and `ListingFoundationTest` fails until
someone has decided which it is.

**Why it is not one price.** Every foundation edit is re-checked; the split is only over whether the
listing keeps earning while it waits.

- **Off search** — `locality`, `propertyType`, `bhk`, `deal`. These change *what the listing
  fundamentally is*, so a stale index entry actively misleads: a 2BHK appearing under 3BHK, or a
  rental under sale, is a wrong answer rather than a slightly stale one.
- **Stays live** — `price`, `furnishing`, `possession`. These change an attribute of a listing that
  is still the same property, so the worst case is a briefly out-of-date number. The same moderator
  work item is raised without touching `status`. Price is the most-edited field on any marketplace
  and the one an owner is most often asked to move; a rule that takes the listing dark for a day
  every time it moves teaches owners not to move it.
- **`address`** also stays live, for a different reason: it is what `AddressKey` derives the
  duplicate signal from, so an edit to it is how a listing moves onto an address somebody else
  already holds. The probe files a note only when the collision exists, and a moderator reading
  "possible duplicate" cannot tell an honest correction from an owner who typed their way onto a
  neighbour's flat. The re-check names the field and is raised either way.

`ListingEditRules.apply` is the one place either set is written down — which set a field belongs to
*is* which flag its block sets, so a field cannot be in both nor silently in neither. The two blocks
are kept first, contiguous and in that order. `frontend/scripts/check-listing-foundation.mjs` parses
them back out of that source **by path** and matches the `apply` signature as a literal, so moving
either is a two-file change.

---

## 3. Contact gate

Lead contact information (owner phone numbers) is masked by default. It is gated behind two
layers, implemented in `src/lib/contact.js` and consumed by
`src/pages/consumer/property/ContactBox.jsx` / `ContactOwnerModal.jsx`.

### Layer 1 - being signed in (and nothing more)

`requestContact(ownerMobile, propId)` needs an account, not a badge. **Identity verification is not
consulted here** — contact is L1 mobile, per ADR-019 ("badge, not gate"). Return values:

- `'login'` - no signed-in user.
- `'unavailable'` - no usable owner identity to address a request to (for example the API returned
  an already-masked number), so we refuse rather than fake a sent request.
- `'verification_required'` - **the single exception, and it belongs to the owner, not to us.** An
  owner who switched on *accept verified contacts only* (`verifiedContactOnly`) narrows their own
  inbox; an unverified requester is then pointed at the badge funnel (`/verify-identity`). Every
  other owner's listings stay open to any signed-in user.

### Layer 2 - Owner approval (maker-checker, section 2)

Once a request exists, it is created with `status: 'pending'` and the owner's
number stays **masked** (`maskPhone`, for example `+91 98xxx xxxx02`) until approval. Status progression via
`contactStatus`:

- `'owner'` - the viewer is the owner themselves (`isOwnerViewer`); always sees the full number.
- `'pending'` - request created, awaiting owner. Number stays masked.
- `'approved'` - owner approved (`setContactStatus(..., 'approved')`); number can unmask.
- `'declined'` - owner declined; stays masked.
- `'none'` - no request yet.

### Trust rules

- **Owner privacy preference.** Even after approval, an owner who set `hideNumber`
  (`getOwnerPrefs` / `ownerHidesNumber` in `src/lib/contact.js`) keeps the raw number masked;
  approved buyers are routed to in-app chat / callback instead. This sits on top of the always-on
  request gate, it does not replace it.
- **Storage keys are shared with the HTML prototype** (`draazyContactReq:<ownerDigits>`), so the
  two prototypes stay compatible.

> **Server-enforced.** The backend returns the raw owner number only after it confirms an approved
> request and `hideNumber=false`; it never ships the raw number to an unapproved client.

---

### Private listing fields on the detail response

`PropertyResponse` carries fields that are withheld by audience rather than merely unused, and
each is absent (`NON_NULL`) rather than null so the response shape does not advertise that something
is being withheld.

- **`address`** — owner and staff only. It carries the flat number because `AddressKey` needs the
  unit token to tell one flat from its neighbour; an address that stops at the building flags a whole
  tower, which nobody can act on. That makes it useful to the duplicate probe and dangerous to
  publish: the contact gate exists so a stranger cannot reach an owner uninvited, and a stranger
  holding "A-902, Rohan Nilay" does not need a phone number, they can knock. The exposure is worst
  for shared accommodation (flatmates), where the occupant is often a single woman living alone in that
  unit. Nothing renders it — the public detail page is built from `society` and `locality` — so it
  is emitted only to round-trip the owner's edit form and to let the desk adjudicate a duplicate.
- **`electricityMeterNo`** — owner and staff only, for the same two reasons: the owner typed it and
  must be able to correct it, and it is the evidence behind a duplicate flag. A meter number names a
  live utility account, one of the few things here a stranger could *act* on rather than merely read.
- **`flagReason`** — back office only. Gated rather than left mechanical, because three separate
  places clear the column (approval through `setStatus`, lowering a flag, the verification service)
  and a public listing carries no reason only for as long as all three keep doing so; one missed
  `setFlagReason(null)` puts a moderator's private note — often quoting a report or naming a
  suspicion about the poster — on the public detail read, where nothing renders it and nobody would
  notice. Withheld from the owner too: the moderator's shorthand is written for the desk, and handing
  it back also hands back whatever the reporter said about them. What an owner is owed is an
  explanation, and that has its own surface in the verification thread.
- **Listing internal state** — `recheckPending/Reason/RequestedAt`, `archived`, `featured`,
  `qualityScore`, `societyId`, `pincode`: owner and staff only (`PrivateFieldVisibility`).
  The public detail page draws none of them, and together they tell a scraper which listings the desk
  is re-checking or promoting.

---

## 4. Soft-delete and audit

### Soft-delete (status flags and archive, not hard delete)

Draazy prefers reversible archival over destructive deletes. The shape is the same wherever it is
applied:

- Archiving sets `archived: true`, `archivedAt` (ISO-8601), and
  `archiveReason`. The record stays in the store; list views filter out `archived` items.
- `restoreRecord(collection, id, statusOverride)` sets `archived: false`, stamps `restoredAt`, and
  can reset `status` (listings restore to `pending`, so they re-enter verification).

Listings wrap these as `archiveListing` / `restoreListing` in
`src/lib/data/properties-admin.js`. The legacy `deleteListing` is retained only for backwards
compatibility and now delegates to `archiveListing` (there is no true hard delete in the property
path).

Lifecycle is also expressed through `status` flags rather than deletion: listings move across
`pending -> approved | rejected | flagged`, and `flagListing` / `clearFlag` toggle a `flagged`
state with a `flagReason` instead of removing anything.

### Timestamps

Records carry `created_at` / `createdAt` and `updated_at` / `updatedAt` (the review record stamps
`updatedAt` on every mutation; `addListing` stamps `createdAt` and `freshenedAt`). Archive/restore
add `archivedAt` / `restoredAt`. The future schema standardizes on `created_at` / `updated_at`
(see [`./data-model.md`](./data-model.md)).

### Audit trail (who / when / what)

An audit entry is `{ id, at (ISO-8601), who, action, detail }`, `who` resolved from the signed-in
staff user.

- Internal notes are a table of their own (`internal_notes`) behind
  `GET|POST /admin/notes/{entityType}/{entityId}`, gated on `notes:read` / `notes:write`. They are
  append-only: a correction is a newer note. See `docs/system/frontend-data-seam.md` for the domain registry.

Admin handlers fire `logAudit(...)` after every mutation (feature toggle, flag, archive, restore,
edit, approve/reject) - see `src/pages/admin/AdminProperties.jsx`.

Owner-side decisions from the dashboard (contact accept/decline, document grant/decline including
grant all, photo resolve/decline, visit status changes, flatmate accept/decline) write their
`audit_log` row server-side, attributed to the session user; a repeated identical decision writes none.

> **MUST be server-enforced later.** Audit and soft-delete are the record of who did what. The
> backend must write audit rows server-side (client-supplied `who` is not trustworthy), enforce
> who may archive/restore, and keep archived rows out of unauthorized reads.

---

## 5. Pagination, sorting, and filtering

The exact query params, the `PageEnvelope` wrapper, and the `?sort=`/`?page=&size=` conventions are
defined in the [OpenAPI spec](../../backend/src/main/resources/static/openapi/draazy-api.yaml)
(`info.description` + `PageEnvelope`/parameter schemas). This section only notes the *behaviour* the
mock layer approximates today.

- **Pagination & sorting:** zero-indexed `page/size`; `sort=field,direction`. Responses use the
  spec's `PageEnvelope`.
- **Filtering:** flat query params per resource (e.g. property search filters on deal, type,
  locality, bhk, price range, furnishing, free text) — see the spec for the authoritative list.
- **Archived filtering:** list endpoints exclude soft-deleted rows by default
  (`archived=false`); an explicit `archived=true` surfaces them for admin views.

In the mock today, filtering/sorting/paging happen in-memory inside the providers and page
components (for example `src/pages/admin/AdminProperties.jsx` computes counts and filters over the
full listing array). The `page/size/sort` contract is what those in-memory operations must map to
once the HTTP provider exists.

---

## 6. Provider seam and error shape

### The seam

Components never talk to `localStorage` or `fetch` directly. They import from a **service** module
(`src/services/*Service.js`), which delegates to the **active provider** selected in
`src/services/config.js`:

```
component  ->  services/xService.js  ->  createProvider('x')  ->  providers/http/xProvider.js
```

- There is one data source: the live API. `createProvider(domain)`
  resolves and caches the provider via a **lazy** `import.meta.glob`, so it returns a *Promise* of
  the provider module and services await it: `(await provider()).foo(...)`. The glob must stay lazy
  — an eager one reinstates an import cycle that blanks the app at bootstrap (tech-debt D208), and
  `scripts/check-provider-cycle.mjs` fails the build if it comes back.
- **All service functions return Promises**, so a caller never depends on when the answer arrives.

Domains wired today: `property`, `auth`, `deal`, `contact`, `finance` (barrel:
`src/services/index.js`).

### Error shape

The HTTP provider must surface failures in the canonical shape defined by the `Error` schema in the
[OpenAPI spec](../../backend/src/main/resources/static/openapi/draazy-api.yaml): a stable machine
`error` code (for example `verification_required`), a user-facing `message`, and the HTTP `status`.
Callers branch on `error`; UIs show `message`.

### Loading / empty / error UI states

Because every call is a Promise, each data-driven view handles three states:

- **Loading** - spinner while the Promise is pending (for example `ModuleRoute` renders a spinner
  while admin roles load).
- **Empty** - a distinct "nothing here yet" state when the resolved list is empty (saved
  properties, notifications, queues), never a blank screen.
- **Error** - render the `message` from the error shape with a retry affordance; do not swallow the
  rejection.

---

## 7. Notifications

In-app notifications are read from the server through `src/services/notificationService.js`; the
frontend no longer derives inbox rows or stores notification state in `localStorage`.
`GET /notifications/unread-count` returns `{ "count": n }`, using the same unread + deliverable
filter as the list. Each row carries a stable `id`, `read` flag, timestamp and link; those server
rows drive both `/notifications` and the header bell. Read rows leave the list after 30 days; all
notification rows are purged after 90 days by `NotificationRetentionSweep`.

The bell's count is pushed, not polled: when a row becomes deliverable, or `markRead` changes one,
`NotificationPublisher` sends an id-free `notification` event on the caller's `/messages/stream`
(through the `LiveUpdates` port), and `NotificationContext` re-reads the count. A row held for quiet
hours is not pushed. The stream hub is per instance, so the client still polls every 5 minutes while
the stream is open, and every 60s while it is not.

Notifications are the natural delivery channel for maker-checker outcomes (contact approved, deal
finalized, listing verified/rejected). The review thread in property verification
(`addReviewMessage` in `properties-admin.js`) plays the same role owner<->admin, carrying the
approval/rejection message with a `read` flag.

Related store events: `src/lib/contact.js` dispatches a `pn:store` `CustomEvent` on owner-pref
changes so open tabs can react without a reload - a lightweight in-app pub/sub the real backend
would replace with push/websockets.

Notification generation belongs on the server as a side-effect of approvals and state changes, not
something the client seeds for itself.

## 8. The backend security filter chain

The reasoning behind `com.draazy.api.security.SecurityConfig`, `WriteRateLimitFilter` and
`MaintenanceModeFilter`. It lives here rather than in those files' comments so the code stays
readable; the code carries one-line pointers back to this section.

### 8.1 Chain shape and filter order

One stateless resource-server chain. No sessions, no CSRF token, default posture `authenticated`;
401/403 render the contract envelope via `RestAuthEntryPoint` / `RestAccessDeniedHandler`.

Three filters are added and **the order is load-bearing**:

0. `OriginGateFilter`, only when `draazy.security.origin-secret` is set, runs ahead of all of them.
   See §8.8.
1. `JwtAuthFilter` — resolves the bearer token.
2. `WriteRateLimitFilter` — counts the request against whoever that turned out to be. The reverse
   order would leave every authenticated caller sharing an address-keyed bucket.
3. `BotDefenceFilter` — challenges the small set of writes anyone on the internet may post to. Last
   of the three because it is the only one that can make a network call, so a flood should already
   have been refused by the counter. `POST /auth/login` is challenged by `AuthController` instead, on
   its send step only: the filter cannot see which step a body is, and the verify step must not need
   a second single-use token.

`MaintenanceModeFilter` is added after `BotDefenceFilter`: the two cheap in-memory defences refuse a
flood before this one asks the database anything, and it has to sit after the JWT filter because it
is answered by a caller's role.

`BotDefenceFilter` is registered unconditionally, unlike the rate limiter: whether it does anything
is decided by which `BotDefence` bean was wired, not by whether the filter is in the chain. One
shape in every environment means the enabled and disabled paths cannot drift, and with the no-op the
per-request cost is a single boolean read. Exactly one `BotDefence` bean always exists (Turnstile
when the flag is on, the no-op otherwise via `matchIfMissing`); it is constructor-injected so a
misconfiguration producing none — or both — fails at startup rather than on the first anonymous form
submission in production.

`RoleSource` is a bean-method parameter rather than a constructor field: it is backed by a JPA
repository, and a `@Configuration` class holding one forces the persistence infrastructure to
initialise ahead of the bean post-processors meant to decorate it. Resolved at chain-assembly time
it is an ordinary singleton lookup.

The rate limiter is switched off for the test run (`src/test/resources/application.properties`):
~700 MockMvc tests all present as one anonymous caller from 127.0.0.1, so a shared bucket would fail
whichever test happened to run 121st. `WriteRateLimitTest` turns it back on with a budget small
enough to reach deliberately.

### 8.2 Why CSRF stays disabled even though a cookie exists

Every mutation authenticates by an `Authorization` header, which no foreign origin can set. The
single exception is `POST /auth/refresh`, which authenticates by the `draazy_rt` cookie
(`identity.auth.RefreshCookie`) alone — and that cookie carries an explicit `SameSite=Lax` (not the
defaulted variety, so Chrome's Lax+POST intervention window does not apply) on a route with no GET
mapping, so a forged cross-site POST arrives with no cookie at all. **If a cookie is ever accepted
for anything else, or that attribute is loosened to `None`, this decision has to be revisited.**

The seam `Lax` does not cover: it is a statement about *sites*, so a sibling subdomain under the same
registrable domain clears it and could drive `/auth/refresh` on a visitor's behalf. No CSRF token
would be reached in time to matter, so that case is settled at the endpoint by
`identity.auth.RefreshOriginGate`, which refuses to rotate for an origin we do not serve.

### 8.3 `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`

Spring Security's own defaults already send `nosniff`, `DENY` and `no-store`. The one it does not
send is `Referrer-Policy`, and this API has a route that needs it: `GET /documents/shared` carries a
bearer credential in its query string, so any URL of ours a browser holds is a secret it must not
forward. `no-referrer` rather than the frontend's `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, because that
policy still sends the full URL — path and query — on same-origin requests, and an API has no
navigation for a `Referer` to be useful to. The static frontend sets its own, looser policy in
`netlify.toml`; the two are independent hosts and independent decisions.

### 8.4 How the public-route matchers are written

Application routes are referenced through `Routes` constants rather than string literals: this file
and the controllers must agree on every path, and a silent typo is a security defect (an endpoint
left guarded that should be public, or a matcher too broad). The docs/actuator paths stay literal —
they belong to the framework and have no controller to drift from.

Three rules hold across the whole `permitAll` block:

- **Per-method, never path-only.** Several routes serve a public GET and an authenticated POST on
  the identical path (the two review routes, `/flatmates/posts`, `/properties/{id}/split`), so a
  path-only `permitAll` would silently open the write side.
- **Exact-path and single-segment.** `ANY_SINGLE` matchers are deliberately one segment, which is
  what keeps `/{id}/archive` and the society residency queue authenticated. Any public two-segment
  child therefore needs its own line — `Routes.Properties.ROOMS`, `Societies.HUB`. `Properties.FEATURED` is named explicitly even though
  `ANY_SINGLE` would already match it, so that a public endpoint is public by decision rather than
  by accident of path depth.
- **Narrow the payload, not just the route.** `GET /owners/{id}` is the only public route that reads
  the users table; the response is capped in `OwnerProfileResponse` and the mobile masked in the
  service. The anonymous society reads withhold a recommended person's number and the resident-group
  invite. The public room and flatmate payloads carry no contact detail.

Why each public family is public:

| Family | Why anonymous |
|---|---|
| `/auth/login`, `/auth/staff-login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/staff-invite/redeem` | The caller holds no session; for the invite redeem, the single-use token **is** the credential, verified in `StaffInviteService`. |
| Catalogue reads (properties, cities, localities, societies, fees) | The pages a visitor sees before deciding whether to sign up at all. |
| `GET /bootstrap` | Its sections (`flags`, `geo`, `cities`, `pricing`, `listingPolicy`, `movePack`, `plans`) decide what a logged-out visitor sees, so an admin-only reader cannot be the client's source for them. Each section is scoped to one block of the settings document, so the rest of `/admin/settings` (fees, permissions, `adminFlags`, the referral auto-qualify threshold, blacklist reasons) stays admin-only. `movePack` is separate from `flags` because the latter is map-of-boolean and would have to drop the prices; the switch travels with the prices it gates so configuration that must be consistent cannot arrive half-applied. |
| `POST /cities/waitlist`, `POST /service-waitlist` | The people these exist for are not users and may never become any. POST-only; reading the leads back is staff/admin, because each row is a name and a mobile number. Each is additionally rate-limited per mobile in its service, and the waitlist is challenged in `BotDefenceFilter`. |
| `POST /demand-signals`, `POST /page-views` | The two high-volume kinds fire on public surfaces, and the demand most worth measuring belongs to the visitor who left without signing up. Write-only by design: the aggregate is on `/admin/supply-gap`, because a public read would hand a competitor a locality-by-locality map of what Draazy is short of. |
| `GET /documents/shared` | The link is forwarded to a lawyer or banker with no Draazy account; the unguessable, expiring share token **is** the credential, checked in `DocumentRequestService.shared`. |
| Cashfree payment webhooks | Server-to-server, no user session; authenticity is an HMAC over the raw body, verified in the handler. |

### 8.5 Write rate limiting

**A filter, opt-out rather than opt-in.** A rule that must be remembered at every new endpoint is
eventually forgotten at the one that matters, and several writes here cost real money or notify a
real person. It runs before authorisation, so refusing costs a map lookup rather than the database
round trip it is trying to prevent.

**The budget is not a performance figure.** It sits far above what a person does and far below what
a script wants; nothing legitimate should ever see a 429 from here, which is the test of whether the
number is right.

**Reads are untouched**, because a GET is cheap, cacheable, idempotent and often anonymous, and
`spring.data.web.pageable.max-page-size` is what bounds read amplification. Two exceptions:
`GET /documents/shared`, where the attack is enumeration — the shape a rate limit answers and an
authorisation rule cannot — and `GET /me/data-export`, which is ~70 queries assembled in memory and
uncacheable because a point-in-time statement must not be stale. The export path is a literal because
this package deliberately imports nothing from a feature package, so a rename fails open and
silently; `WriteRateLimitTest.dataExportIsLimited` drives a real request through the filter.
Membership is tested on path and not method, because Spring MVC dispatches HEAD to `@GetMapping`
handlers and merely suppresses the body — allowing HEAD through unlimited would make the enumeration
defence bypassable by a one-character change.

**Anonymous listing reads** (`GET`/`HEAD` on `/properties` and below) have their own per-address
bucket, `draazy.security.rate-limit.property-reads-per-window` (default 600 a minute), so a scraper
walking the catalogue is refused while a person browsing never meets it. Signed-in callers are not
metered here.

**Provider callbacks get their own budget rather than an exemption.** They cannot share the ordinary
bucket: they arrive from a handful of provider addresses, and a refused callback is a customer who
paid and was not credited. Nor may they be exempt — they are `permitAll`, so an attacker can send
them, and the HMAC only rejects an unsigned body after the container has buffered it and the handler
has materialised it as a string. The 50× multiplier is sized for a provider replaying a backlog after
an outage, all from one address, while still bounding an anonymous flood to something the heap
survives. It is computed as a `long` and clamped: at `int` width the multiplication wraps above
42,949,672 and would quietly hand the callbacks a *smaller* budget than everyone else.

**Callback bodies are capped at 64 KiB.** Nothing else bounds them: Tomcat's `maxPostSize` covers
only form encoding and `spring.servlet.multipart` only multipart, so an `application/json` body is
unlimited in this stack. The handler takes the raw body as a `String` because the signature is over
exact bytes, so an unsigned body is materialised on the heap roughly three times before the HMAC is
consulted; a real Cashfree callback is a couple of kilobytes. A negative `Content-Length` means
unknown (`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`) and passes any `> cap` test, so it is refused too — otherwise
the ceiling is bypassable by one request header. The constant is `64L * 1024` so the expression stays
in `long`: at `int` width, raising it past 2 GiB overflows negative and the bound inverts.

**Bucket keys.** Prefixed by kind (`u:`, `ip:`, and separate `w`/`cb` store namespaces) so a user id
can never collide with an address, and so one namespace cannot add every instance's callbacks to
every instance's users on a shared Redis backend. Anonymous writes fall back to the client address,
which is only sound if `getRemoteAddr()` really is the client's: behind an undeclared load balancer
every anonymous caller shares one bucket and a single host can 429 the platform. `TrustedProxyConfig`
makes the topology an explicit declaration; the filter logs loudly — **once**, because a line per
request would be an unauthenticated log-amplification tap — the first time `X-Forwarded-For` arrives
while that declaration says nothing is in front. The header is never read for keying, as that would
let every caller choose their own bucket. An IPv6 address is collapsed to its /64, because a single
host is routinely assigned an entire /64 and can source from any address in it at no cost; the cost
is that distinct users behind one /64 share a bucket, the trade already accepted for IPv4 behind a
carrier NAT. `isNumericIpv6` guards `InetAddress.getByName`, which resolves anything that is not a
literal — a non-numeric argument would turn a key derivation into a blocking DNS lookup on the
request thread.

**Path normalisation closes specific bypasses.** `getRequestURI()` is raw while the dispatcher routes
on the decoded path, so a raw comparison misses `/documents/share%64`; Spring's path matching also
excludes `;name=value` path parameters, so `/documents/shared;x=1` reaches the same handler. Decode
*then* cut, which is the order `UrlPathHelper` uses and is itself a bypass — cutting first leaves
`%3b` intact, so `/documents/shared%3Bx=1` would match nothing while still routing to the protected
handler. `StrictHttpFirewall` rejects both shapes today, which is why this is exercised rarely and no
reason to depend on it. Derived from `getContextPath()`/`getRequestURI()` rather than
`getServletPath()`, which agrees in a real container and not under MockMvc; a helper that behaves
differently in tests proves nothing.

**`Retry-After` is set as a header *and* carried in the message**: the header is what a well-behaved
client and every HTTP proxy understand, the message is what a person reads in a toast. The message
text is ASCII-only, because `SecurityErrors` hand-writes the body through the response writer without
pinning a charset and a punctuation flourish would reach the client as mojibake.

### 8.6 Maintenance mode

The client overlay is a statement about what one browser draws, not about what the platform accepts;
`MaintenanceModeFilter` is the half that holds against an open tab, a stale flag payload, a script or
curl.

**Writes only; reads are deliberately left alone.** The danger maintenance mode exists for — a
migration or backfill running while users mutate rows — is entirely on the write path. Blocking reads
would add a settings lookup to every anonymous GET, turn one slow tiny table into a total outage, and
remove the only thing a visitor can still usefully do. The "can this change state" answer is shared
with `WriteRateLimitFilter.MUTATING` rather than restated, since two copies drift the day a method is
added.

**Three exemptions, each of which would otherwise be a bug:**

- *Staff and administrators* must still be able to work, including in the back office where the
  switch that ends the window lives. Keyed on the authority `JwtAuthFilter` resolved, so no path list
  can fall behind the routes.
- *Everything under `/auth/`*, or the maintenance page's link to `/staff-login` is a dead end and the
  only way back in is a hand-edited row. Nothing under that prefix mutates consumer data.
- *Signed provider callbacks.* A payment callback is a fact that already happened
  elsewhere; refusing it discards a write rather than preventing one, and money the customer has paid
  goes uncredited once the provider's retries run out. Listed by route constant rather than by prefix:
  a hole in a maintenance gate should be exactly two paths wide.

Exemption is checked before the flag is read, so an exempt caller costs no query. The flag itself is
read per write request, uncached: a cache would make switching on take effect "shortly", and the
whole value of the switch is that it takes effect now. If the settings table cannot answer,
`PlatformSettings.maintenanceMode()` propagates rather than guessing.

**503 and not 403:** a 403 makes every client offer to sign in as somebody permitted, which does not
end a maintenance window. No `Retry-After` — nobody knows how long the window is, and an invented
number is a false statement in a header clients act on.

### 8.7 Uploads: why photos and documents have separate validators

`PhotoUploads` and `DocumentUploads` guard opposite kinds of object. A document is private, served
behind a signed URL, so the vault can afford to accept PDFs. A photo is world-readable: `PhotoService`
routes it through `storePublic` to a CDN URL anyone can open with no signature. That raises the stakes
on exactly one thing — active content. An SVG or HTML file served from a Draazy-looking CDN origin is
stored XSS, so the photo allowlist is raster images only: no PDF, and above all no SVG, which is XML
the browser will execute. Sharing one validator would mean widening the document allowlist or
narrowing the photo one at every call site. Only signature detection is shared; each surface owns its
allowed types.

**The declared type is a claim; the leading bytes are evidence.** The declared `Content-Type` must be
on the allowlist *and* the file's own signature must independently resolve to the same image family —
a `text/html` payload sent as `image/png` passes the first check and fails the second. The stored
content type is the one the bytes prove, never the one the client sent, so a mislabelled file cannot
come back out of the CDN with a `Content-Type` that makes a browser render it as something dangerous.

**What this deliberately does not do:** it does not decode the image. The threat is a file that is not
an image at all. Leading signatures identify the family; they do not prove the image is well-formed.

**`PhotoService` is stateless and the key is server-minted.** It writes no row and touches no
`Property` — in the create-listing wizard the photos are chosen before the property exists, and the
listing contract already persists whatever image URLs it is given. The key is
`photos/{tag}/{uuid}[-{pHash}]`, so the client's filename decides nothing: traversal and overwriting
another owner's object are impossible by construction rather than by sanitising. `tag` is 16 hex of
HMAC(owner, uuid) (`PhotoKeys`): a public photo URL names no user, yet `ListingPhotoSources` can still
prove the uploader. Keys minted before the tag (`photos/{ownerId}/?`) stay valid and were not backfilled.

**`DocumentScanner` is a list, not a bean.** The caller injects `List<DocumentScanner>` because the
implementations are not alternatives — the built-in structural checker and a clamd daemon answer
different questions, and a deployment with both wants both. Every registered implementation runs in
registration order and any one may refuse, so adding one only ever narrows what is accepted.
Implementations must be side-effect free and must not mutate the byte array several of them share.
An implementation that cannot reach a verdict throws: an undecidable upload must fail, never pass.

The verdict carries three outcomes rather than a boolean, because two are already different HTTP
answers (413 too large, 415 unacceptable content) and collapsing them would force the caller to parse
the detail string. That string is shown to the uploader, so it must describe the *file* and never the
scanner's internals — a clamd signature name is a fingerprint of our configuration.

The seam is shared kernel and cannot see the vault's own `DocumentUploads` allowlist. The caller runs
that first and passes in the type it *proved* from the bytes, so a scanner is told the answer rather
than re-deriving it. OCR-based validation ("does this scan of an Index II read like one") is intended
to arrive as another implementation on this seam, not as a branch inside an existing one.

### 8.8 Origin gate

On a deploy the API is reached through the Cloudflare Pages Function, but Cloud Run's `*.run.app` URL
is public too (`ingress: all`, `allUsers` invoker), because a Worker calls it from the public
internet. A proxy in front protects nothing while the origin behind it answers anyone, so
`OriginGateFilter` refuses any request whose `X-Proxy-Auth` header does not equal
`draazy.security.origin-secret`. The Function sets that header and overwrites any value the client
sent.

- **Why a shared secret.** Restricted ingress needs a paid Google load balancer. Cloudflare's
  Authenticated Origin Pulls need an origin that verifies client certificates, and Cloud Run does not.
  A secret costs nothing and also makes a leaked Cloud Run URL harmless.
- **Why first in the chain.** A request that skipped the proxy has no trustworthy address to
  rate-limit on, and it is owed no token parse. It still sits behind Spring Security's firewall,
  which rejects `..` and encoded separators before the probe exemption is matched.
- **The probe exemption** is `GET`/`HEAD` on three exact paths (`/actuator/health`, `/liveness`,
  `/readiness`), because Cloud Run's probes and CI's smoke test reach the container directly. Health
  is already public, so the exemption exposes nothing new. It is method-bound because the write rate
  limiter runs after the gate: an ungated `POST` there would be charged to a forged
  `X-Forwarded-For` address once `INTERNAL_PROXIES` is widened.
- **Fail-closed configuration.** A blank value fails the boot, and so does a value under 32
  characters. `none` turns the gate off, and it is the base-file value because nothing proxies a
  developer machine. The deploy profiles read `${ORIGIN_SHARED_SECRET}` with no default, and
  `ProdProfileContractTest` pins that.
- **What it unlocks.** With the gate on, only the Function can write the left-most `X-Forwarded-For`
  entry, so `INTERNAL_PROXIES` can be widened safely. Without the gate the same value is spoofable.
  See `docs/DEPLOY.md` §4.

## 9. Client-side seams: caching, commit-on-release, and shared overlays

### `lib/searchCache.js` — one result set, fetched at most once

A faceted search is not a stream of unrelated requests. It is a walk around a small graph of result
sets the user keeps returning to: they tick a filter and untick it, switch to the map and back, page
forward and back, open a property and press Back. Each of those returns to a set the browser already
has, and without a cache each one is a fresh round trip plus — on the listings endpoint — three SQL
statements, to be told something it was told a moment ago.

Three jobs, deliberately in one module because they share the same key and get them wrong
separately:

1. **Remember** a settled result for a short while, so going back to a set is free.
2. **Dedupe** concurrent reads of the same key, so React's StrictMode double-effect (and any
   re-render race) is one request rather than two.
3. **Cancel** a read nobody is waiting for any more. Superseded requests were already discarded on
   arrival by the caller's sequence guard, but discarding an answer does not un-ask the question —
   the server had already run the whole query. This is the only one of the three that reduces
   *server* load rather than client latency.

**Public reads only.** Entries are keyed by the query and by nothing else, so a cache instance must
only ever hold responses that do not depend on who is asking. The listings and flatmates searches
qualify: both are `auth: false` and hard-floored to approved, public rows server-side. Point it at
an authenticated endpoint and one account would be served another's answer after a sign-out and
sign-in in the same tab — silently, and only for the window of the TTL, which is the hardest kind of
leak to reproduce. If that is ever needed the account must become part of the key; a logout hook is
not enough, because a key that omits the identity is wrong even with perfect invalidation.

The `key` must include *everything* that changes the answer — the facets, the sort, the page and the
page size — because two requests are the same request exactly when it matches. The fetcher is handed
a signal that fires when the last interested caller has gone away and must pass it to `http`; a
fetcher that ignores it makes job 3 silently a no-op. A caller's own `signal` is **not** the fetch's
signal: several callers can share one flight, and cancelling on the first would break the readers
still waiting. `fresh: true` skips the remembered value but deliberately not the dedupe, so two
simultaneous refreshes are still one request. A cache hit resolves through a promise rather than
being returned directly, because ordering that changes with cache state is how a "sometimes" bug is
made.

The last subscriber out cancels **and retires the flight in the same breath, synchronously**. Both
halves are load-bearing: `fetch` does not reject until a microtask after `abort()`, so the entry
would otherwise sit in `inflight`, already doomed, for any read starting in between — and that
window is not hypothetical, because StrictMode runs effect → cleanup → effect back to back on mount,
so in development the *second* run would join the flight the first one just killed, receive its
`AbortError`, correctly swallow it as its own cancellation, and leave the screen loading forever.
The flight's own `finally` also deletes, guarded on identity, so neither can strand a newer flight
for the same key. The cache's abort rejection is named `AbortError` so it is indistinguishable from
the platform's, which is what lets `http.isAbort` be the single test every caller uses.

### `lib/useCommitOnRelease.js` — a slider is one decision, not a hundred

A `<input type="range">` reports every step of a drag. That is correct for the *control* — the thumb
has to follow the finger — but wrong for anything downstream that treats a value change as an
intent. On the listings page a filter change becomes `GET /properties`, so a drag across a 100-step
budget slider is ~100 requests and ~100 URL rewrites for one decision.

**The native `change` event, not a list of gestures.** The platform already draws this distinction:
a range fires `input` continuously while the value is explored and `change` once, when it settles.
React aliases its `onChange` prop to the *former*, which is why `change` has to be reached through a
listener rather than a prop. Do not replace it with an enumeration of gestures (`pointerup`,
`keyup`): that covers a mouse and a keyboard and misses everything else — iOS VoiceOver's slider
*adjust* gesture sets the value through the accessibility API, producing `input` and `change` but no
pointer or key event at all, so a screen-reader user would hear the value change while the results
never moved. Deferring to `change` also closes the pointer-released-outside-the-element case for
free.

**Why the commit is not quite immediate.** A range fires `input` **and** `change` on every keyboard
step, so holding an arrow key auto-repeats the pair — crossing a hundred steps that way is ~80
superseded searches, for the one group the switch to `change` exists to serve. A settled value
therefore waits 120 ms for another to replace it: long enough to swallow auto-repeat (~30 ms between
steps), short enough to stay imperceptible after a release. It is not a debounce — it sits on this
control rather than the shared query, starts only once the value has *settled*, and a drag never
enters it.

**Why not a debounce.** Wrong shape twice over: it still fires mid-drag (a slow four-second drag
under a 250 ms debounce is sixteen requests for one decision), and it would have to sit on the
shared query, where it would also delay the discrete filters — a checkbox, a chip — that should feel
instant because each already is exactly one intent.

Render every readout from the returned value, not the owner's: the figure beside the thumb, a
preset's active state, a derived "≈ 4 km" line. Any that keeps reading the owner's copy freezes for
the length of the drag while the thumb moves beneath it, and an `aria-pressed` left behind that way
announces a selection the user has already left. That is also why the value is state rather than a
ref. A non-primitive `value` (`DualRange`'s `[lo, hi]`) must be referentially stable — rebuilt
inline it reads as a fresh commit on every parent render and yanks the thumb back mid-drag.

The hook tracks the last *seen* committed value rather than clearing the live one on commit, because
the owner writes through `startTransition` and the new value arrives some renders later — clearing
on commit would drop the thumb back to the old figure until it did. `Object.is` rather than `!==`,
so a `NaN` value cannot re-enter the render forever and blow up as "Too many re-renders". The commit
closure is assigned in a layout effect rather than during render, because `startTransition` renders
are ones React is free to throw away and a ref written by a discarded render would keep a value that
was never shown; it must not be memoised either, since it has to close over the latest live value.
`onBlur` is a backstop for anything that moved the value and never settled it — committing twice is
harmless, because the second carries the same value and the query key does not move.
`onPointerCancel` discards instead: the browser is saying the gesture was *taken away*, most often
by the scroller claiming a drag that began on the thumb, so committing there would search for a
value the user never chose. The `ref` cleanup flushes rather than drops, because the control usually
leaves when its section collapsed or the drawer closed.

### `lib/useSwipeDismiss.js`

Drag-to-dismiss for mobile overlays: `axis: 'y'` is the bottom-sheet gesture, `axis: 'x'` the side
drawer's. Both are mobile-only — the gesture never arms unless the phone media query matches.
Pointer capture is taken on the first qualifying *move*, never on `pointerdown`: capturing eagerly
retargets the following `click` to the panel and breaks every button inside it. A vertical drag may
only begin in the top 40 px (handle and header), because below it the sheet's own content scrolls
and a drag that could mean either would make both feel unreliable. A `pointerdown` on a range input
is excluded outright — a range thumb *is* a drag handle, so without this the drawer's left-drag arms
alongside it and a slider can only be nudged a few pixels before the panel slides away. On release,
a dismissal hands the transform back to the stylesheet so the overlay's own close animation plays;
a snap-back has no such animation to borrow, so one is supplied and then cleared, or the inline rule
outlives the gesture and overrides the stylesheet on the *next* dismissal.

### `context/PostChooserContext.jsx`

One posting sheet for the whole consumer shell, mounted once here rather than by whoever owns a Post
button, so every posting control — the bottom bar's `+`, the Flatmates tab-row `Post`, the Flatmates
empty state — opens the *same* instance instead of copies kept in step by hand. The provider holds
nothing but "is it open": every branch of the sheet navigates, so there is no per-route handler to
register.

The open flag is a **second** context on purpose. `openPostChooser` never changes, so the many
consumers that only need to open the sheet — `useFlatmates` spreads it down through the whole
board — re-render exactly never; `open` changes on every use and only the bottom bar subscribes, to
report `aria-expanded`. Folding the two together would make opening the sheet re-render the
Flatmates board underneath it. `usePostChooser()` throws rather than no-oping, because a Post button
that silently does nothing is the kind of failure that ships.

### `lib/hooks.js` — draft autosave

`useFormDraft` serialises during render and debounces on the **result** rather than on `form`. Every
caller builds its form object fresh on each render (`captureShareableState()` and friends), so
`form` has a new identity even when nothing was typed; keying the effect on that identity measures
400 ms from the last *render*, not the last *change*, and any render cadence faster than the
debounce re-arms the timer forever so the draft is never written at all — the failure nobody notices
until a customer loses a form. The string is what gets stored anyway, so this is work moved earlier,
not extra work.

`flush()` writes the draft now instead of `debounce` ms from now. The debounced save's cleanup
clears the pending timer on unmount, so a caller that deliberately navigates away — a sign-in gate,
say — destroys the very write it was counting on, and everything typed in the last 400 ms is gone.
That is invisible in manual testing, because a human takes longer than 400 ms to move from the last
input to the button. Any gate that sends someone off the page and promises their work will be there
must call it first. It is deliberately not `useCallback`-wrapped: it has to close over the current
`form`, so memoising it would only imply a stability it cannot have. It raises no "Draft saved"
flash, because a pill animating onto a screen mid-navigation reads as a glitch.

The flash element's presentation and placement live in `index.css` (`.dz-autosave-flash`), never in
inline `cssText`: a body-level node cannot see the `--dz-bottom-inset` `ConsumerLayout` sets on its
own wrapper, and JS has no view of the breakpoint that decides whether the bottom bar exists, so an
inline offset parks the pill on top of the mobile tab bar.

Restore-on-mount only lets fields the user actually filled override the form's defaults; empty draft
values must not wipe smart defaults.

**Changing a form's field shape means renaming its `dzDraft:*` key.** A deploy replaces the code but
not the browser's storage, so the next visit parses yesterday's draft with today's reader: a
renamed, retyped or re-scaled field is spread back into the form unchallenged, and — because
restore only skips *empty* values — a stale one wins over the new default and can be submitted.
Nothing heals this the way the server heals a stale session, since a draft exists precisely because
no server has seen it yet. Rename rather than version in place — suffix the key and let the old one
become unreadable by construction, the way `dz_pob_draft_v1` and `draazyDB_v5` already spell it
elsewhere. A wrapper would be the alternative, and a worse one: the rent-agreement redaction pass
reads the raw draft to strip PAN and Aadhaar before `useFormDraft` ever sees it, and would have to
learn to read through the box. The old blob is left behind for the browser to evict.

### `lib/useSocietyCatalogue.js`

A **completeness** gate, not a loading gate. `data/societies.js` answers synchronously with 28
curated rows until its 182 KB bulk chunk lands, so a surface claiming to show the whole catalogue
must put this flag in the dependency list of the memo that reads it, or it paints 28 of 348 and
never corrects itself. The first render still paints from the curated rows. It costs one re-render
and zero bytes, because every accessor calls `ensureSocietyCatalogue()` anyway. A failed load stays
`false` and does not rethrow: `ensureSocietyCatalogue` has dropped its cached promise so the next
read retries, and resolving `true` would tell a surface its partial 28-row view is complete.

### Public reference reads — memory, browser and edge (`PublicReadCacheFilter`)

Every page render reads the same answers that do not vary by caller: `/bootstrap` (flags, geo,
cities, pricing, listing policy, Move-in Pack, plans, the live listing `counts` and the `trustStats`
headline in one body), `/fees`, `/localities`, `/faqs`, `/properties/featured`,
`/properties/search-index` and `/societies/top`. Answering each from
Postgres every time spends the 20-connection budget (4 instances × pool 5) on a constant. Three free
layers absorb them instead, without Redis:

1. **Backend memory.** `PublicReadCacheFilter` keeps the 200 body per URL and query for
   `draazy.cache.public-reads.ttl` (`PUBLIC_READ_CACHE_TTL`, default 30s). It holds at most 256
   entries, evicting least-recently-used first. It runs after Spring Security, so a hit still passes
   the origin gate, CORS and the security headers. Non-200 answers are never stored.
2. **Browser.** It answers `Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds left>, public` with a weak `ETag` (Tomcat
   will not gzip a response carrying a strong one; `server.compression.enabled` gzips JSON over 2 KB),
   and answers `304` to a matching `If-None-Match`. Because max-age counts down to the entry's expiry, memory and
   browser together never exceed one TTL.
3. **Edge.** The Pages proxy (`functions/api/[[path]].js`) stores an anonymous GET in the Cloudflare
   Cache API only when the backend marked the 200 `public` with a positive max-age and set no cookie.
   The edge's copy can then live one more TTL in a browser, so **an anonymous visitor sees an edit at
   most 2 × TTL (60s) late**.

**Staff and the editing admin see changes instantly; signed-in consumers within one TTL.** `http.js`
sends every read by a staff or admin user as `cache: 'no-cache'`, which makes the browser add
`Cache-Control: max-age=0`. The edge and the filter both treat that as a bypass. The filter also
recomputes and refreshes its entry, so the next anonymous read on that instance is fresh too. A
`Cache-Control` the browser adds does not trigger a CORS preflight.

A successful `/admin/**` write clears the filter's entries on the instance that took it; the other
instances serve out their TTL. Property writers are too many, and bulk or native queries skip
entity listeners, so for everything else the TTL is the contract. Add a path to `PATHS` only if its
answer is identical for every caller: anything personalised would leak between users.
`ANONYMOUS` holds the public catalogue reads (search, listing detail, cards, reviews, owner, locality,
society and flatmate pages) whose answer varies only for a signed-in viewer; they are cached only
for a request with no `Authorization` header and answer `Vary: Authorization`, so a browser never
replays the anonymous copy after sign-in.
`PermissionMap` stays uncached on purpose.

In the browser, `http.js` shares one fetch between concurrent identical GETs, keeps `/bootstrap` for
the same 30s, and drops every kept read on any successful write or `draazy-settings-change`. The
signed-in shell's five reads (profile, plan state, saved keys, both unread counts) arrive as one
`GET /me/bootstrap`, which seeds those reads at boot and sign-in
(`services/meBootstrapService.js`); a section that failed comes back `null` and the client re-reads
it from its own endpoint. Identity, saved searches and followed societies are read only when a screen
that draws them mounts. The owner dashboard and hub do the same with `GET /me/dashboard` (`services/meDashboardService.js`):
 `X-Draazy-Build`. A replayed stamp from before a deploy would raise a false
"new version" banner, and every other response still carries the stamp.

Tests and the e2e profile set the TTL to `0s`, which makes the filter inert. Specs reset the database
under live JVMs and expect an anonymous page to see an admin edit immediately.
`PublicReadCacheFilterTest` proves the cache's behaviour instead.

### Platform settings rows — `SettingsCache`

Staff bypass the filter above, and the commission, flag, geo and Move-in Pack reads behind
`/bootstrap` and many write paths each read a `platform_settings` row. `SettingsCache` keeps each row
for `draazy.cache.settings.ttl` (`SETTINGS_CACHE_TTL`, default 30s), so a hit borrows no pool
connection. `AdminSettingsService.update` clears it after commit on the instance that took the write;
other instances catch up within one TTL. Kill switches (`PlatformSettings.flag`: maintenance mode,
signups, staff login) and `PermissionMap` always read fresh: a stale "off" there is a security
failure, not a display lag. Tests and e2e run with `0s`; `SettingsCacheTest` proves the cache.

### Listing photos — card copies and an immutable CDN

Photos never pass through Spring on the way to a browser: the JSON carries URLs and the browser
fetches them from R2. So the saving is in what is fetched, not in a server cache.

- **Card copies.** `PhotoService.upload` stores `{key}.w960.jpg` and `{key}.w480.jpg`
  (`PhotoVariants`, JPEG q0.8, never upscaled) *before* the original, so a returned URL always has
  them. `PropertyImage` uses them by default via `cardSrcSet` (`lib/imgSrcSet.js`), with
  `sizes="240px"` unless the caller passes a wider one; so cards, thumbnails, map popups and admin
  queues all get them. Only the property gallery and lightbox load the original. An undecodable
  image is stored without copies rather than refused.
- **Immutable.** Keys are never reused, so `R2FileStorage.storePublic` sets
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- **Service worker.** `dz-images` caches only the copies. Originals are also fetched with CORS for
  the wizard's canvas hash, and a cached opaque response would break that read.
- **Older uploads have no copies.** `PropertyImage` drops the srcset on the first error and shows the
  original, at the cost of one 404 per render.

## JWT auth filter

Rationale relocated from `JwtAuthFilter` Javadoc.

A valid token yields an `AuthPrincipal` with a single `ROLE_<role>` authority (so
`@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` works); anything invalid is left unauthenticated and the entry
point returns 401 for protected routes. The filter never throws - a bad token is simply "no auth",
not a 500.

**The role comes from the database, not from the token.** The token says who the caller was when it
was minted; `RoleSource` says what they are now, and this is the one place both the route guards
and the two capability resolvers read it from, so resolving it here fixes all of them at once and
adds no second mechanism to keep in step. Otherwise a permission taken away in the back office lands
on the caller's next request while a role change taken away in the same screen does not land until
their token expires - two gestures that sit side by side in the console behaving differently.

Read per request rather than cached, for the same reason `PermissionMap` and `AccountPermissions`
are: a cache is a window during which a revocation has visibly been made and is not yet true. Only
the role is re-resolved; `team` is a staff account's desk rather than a privilege level, and every
guard that reads it is already gated on a role the filter has just confirmed. No row means the
database has nothing to say and the claim stands.

**A failure to read it is not caught.** `PermissionMap` swallows a malformed document because a
typo in a hand-edited config row must not be an outage; this is not that. The only way this lookup
fails is the database being unreachable, and a request whose authorisation could not be established
must not proceed as though it had - every controller behind the filter needs the same database
anyway, so falling back would trade a 500 for a 500 and grant whatever the token asked for on the
way.

## Permission map

Rationale relocated from `PermissionMap` Javadoc.

### Does editing this map change access control, and by how much?

**Yes, and only downwards.** Every capability check in this codebase is `and`-ed onto the
`@PreAuthorize` role guard that was already there; none replaces one, and none is ever the only
guard on a route. So the map can take capabilities away from a role, and can hand a capability to a
team *within* a role that already reaches the route - but there is no value an administrator can
write into it that lets a buyer reach a staff route, or staff reach an admin-only one. Widening the
four-role baseline requires editing Java, which is the point: this document is edited through a web
form by whoever currently holds the admin password.

**It governs the ops population, keyed the way the document is keyed.** An admin resolves to the
literal key `admin`; a staff member resolves to their team. Those are the only keys the seeded
document has, and the only two things the JWT carries that could address a group of people. The key
is read off the signature-verified principal and nothing else - no request parameter, header or body
field can influence which bundle applies, because a key the client could choose would be an
allow-list the client could opt out of.

### The two ways it answers "yes" without consulting anything

Both are a deliberate refusal to invent policy, and both land exactly on the existing role baseline
rather than above it. Each is about the *document* being absent or unusable, a global state in which
"the compiled-in policy applies" is the honest reading; neither exempts one account while governing
its colleagues.

1. **No `permissions` row.** The honest reading of "no policy is configured" is "the compiled-in
   policy applies", not "nobody may do anything". This mirrors `PlatformSettings`, which resolves
   every missing or malformed config value to its compiled-in default rather than failing the
   request: a config store an operator edits by hand must not be able to take the platform down by
   being absent.
2. **The row is unparseable, or is not a JSON object.** `AdminSettings` declares `permissions` as
   `additionalProperties: true`, so an admin can store an array or a string there and the settings
   endpoint will accept it. A document whose shape cannot be an allow-list is not a restrictive
   allow-list, it is a broken one, and treating a typo as a lockout of the entire back office would
   make this class the outage.

### And the ways it answers "no" on silence

Once the document *is* a well-formed object and the caller *does* have a key, an absent key or a
non-array value is a **denial**. That is what makes this an allow-list rather than a suggestion: if
omission meant "allow", an administrator could never remove access by editing the map.

**A staff caller with no team is denied for the same reason**, and this is the largest omission of
all. `users.team` is nullable, so such an account is legal at the column and the document has no
key that addresses it. Granting invents a policy too, and it is the one an administrator cannot undo:
every edit they make leaves that account untouched, while a team that *is* named but emptied holds
nothing. The way to give a colleague the most authority would be to give them no desk, which inverts
the whole document, and silently, because the console reports a narrowed platform either way. The
lockout this would ordinarily risk is closed at the other end: `UserAdminService.addStaff` refuses
to create a staff account without a known team, so the state is unreachable going forward rather than
merely punished on arrival. Per-account scoping remains a separate, still-open item, and denying an
unnameable caller is not a scoping rule - it is the allow-list declining to guess. The `admin` role
is unaffected: it resolves to the literal key `admin`, so it is nameable without a team.

The obvious hazard of deny-on-omission is a partial map locking out teams the author never thought
about, so `R__DML_seed_permission_map.sql` seeds a *complete* one (every team, plus `admin`) and
merges the defaults into whatever a deployment already had; the settings endpoint's merge semantics
mean a key cannot subsequently be deleted at all, only emptied. An administrator therefore edits one
team's bundle without silently changing five others.

### What it does not do

It does not read `settings.customRoles`, and nothing can store one: the key is deleted by `V61`
and refused with 422 by `AdminSettingsService`. It was keyed by a `roleId` no user row, JWT claim
or endpoint has ever carried, it spoke the admin client's module vocabulary rather than
`Capabilities`, and it composed by *union* where this class may only ever narrow - so honouring it
would have widened access on the strength of a document written while it granted nothing.

The SpEL entry point refuses anything that is not one of our own authenticated principals rather than
waving it through. That case is unreachable today (every call site `and`s it onto a role check
anonymous cannot pass), so the branch is not load-bearing - but a SpEL fragment is a string, and the
day somebody uses one of these constants on its own the failure should be a 403 rather than a silent
grant.

## Back office permissions

Rationale relocated from `BackOfficePermissions` Javadoc.

### Functions are stored; atoms are enforced

Operators grant function names such as `kyc`, `listingModeration` and `desk:rental`. The server
derives permission atoms such as `identity:write`, `properties:moderate` and `services:read` from
that function catalogue, then intersects the atom set with the account role ceiling. Any
back-office account also keeps `dashboard:read`.

### Every name here guards a real route

**The catalogue contains exactly what is enforced, and nothing else.** That is the lesson of `V61`:
`settings.customRoles` held a vocabulary (`enquiries`, stale module keys) that no server code
mapped onto anything, so an administrator populated an access-control document that granted nothing,
and the day somebody wired it, it would have started granting whatever had accumulated. A name is
added in the same change that annotates the route it guards, never before - and
`BackOfficeAccessService` refuses to store a name outside the catalogue, which stops the console's
module keys reappearing in the database under a different roof. `Capabilities` keeps one unenforced
name (`export_csv`) only because it is *stored data* predating the guard that cannot be renamed
without a migration; this vocabulary ships with its guards, so it holds the stricter rule.

### The role ceiling and defaults

Each atom records which roles may *ever* hold it, taken from the `@PreAuthorize` role guard already
on the route. `baselineFor` turns that into the set an unscoped account of that role holds, and
`AccountPermissions` resolves a stored document by intersecting it with that set. So an
administrator who writes `settings:write` into a staff account's document changes nothing: the atom
is not in the staff baseline, the intersection drops it, and the route's own `hasRole('ADMIN')`
would have refused it anyway. Two independent fences, deliberately - if the ceiling were ever
mis-declared too generously, the role guard on the route is still there. Roles outside the back
office (`buyer`, `owner`) get an empty baseline, an unreachable but fail-closed answer.

The administrator always holds the full technical baseline: any stored document is ignored and
`PUT /users/{id}/permissions` refuses an admin target (422), so the single admin can never be
narrowed. With no stored document, a manager gets every function plus `users:write` and
`audit:read`, and staff gets only `dashboard:read` (fail-closed). Staff desk scope comes from
`desk:*` functions, not from the legacy `users.team` column.

Managers watch staff through `/admin/staff-activity` (feed + leaderboard) and
`/admin/team-performance` (per-staff counts by function, open items, oldest waiting and median
time-to-decision per queue); both are `audit:read` and scoped to staff rows.

The SpEL fragments are spelled out as concatenations of constants because an annotation argument must
be a compile-time constant expression, and they are always `and`-ed onto the role guard already on
the route, never used alone. That is the mechanism, not a convention: this document may narrow what a
role can do and may never be the thing that decides whether the caller is ops.

### Individual atom decisions

- **`identity_reviews:read`** is split out of `users:read`, which also opens the whole account
  directory. Reviewing captured ID photos is a desk job with its own shift, and a queue that can only
  be granted together with the directory is one an ops lead grants the directory for.
  `identity_reviews:write` is admin only, narrowing a grant without widening an audience: deciding
  a badge and minting an admin colleague were the same checkbox and are not the same job.
- **`notes:read`** is deliberately not folded into the atom of the queue the note hangs off. Notes
  span four families; granting them through `properties:read` would mean an account cleared to
  browse listings could also read every staff observation about every person, because the notes are
  one table and the read is one route. `notes:write` is separate again, because more people should
  read a case file than add to it.
- **`properties:verify` / `properties:moderate`** split property trust decisions from listing
  moderation actions such as approve, reject, feature, flag, review and locality filing.
- **`enquiries`** has no `write`, and that is a product decision. Every row the demand board shows
  belongs to two other people - a contact request is the owner's to approve, a visit the
  participants' to confirm or move, a deal the owner's to close. Ops watching demand health is a
  different job from ops answering on somebody's behalf, and the console's old "mark responded" /
  "close" buttons wrote the owner's decision field with the operator's opinion. A write atom would
  have to name a route that does that, so there is neither; the console offers an internal note under
  `notes:write` instead - the operator's opinion recorded as the operator's opinion, beside the row
  rather than inside it. Nor is there an `enquiries:reveal`: the detail routes that unmask one
  contact number are guarded by this same atom with the *role* term raised to `admin`, the way
  `users:read` guards both the masked directory and the audited user detail. Unmasking is a
  narrower audience for one capability rather than a separate one, and a grid that grows a row per
  shade of the same permission stops being read.
- **`postOnBehalf:write`** is a write with no matching read, uniquely. The module is a single form
  with nothing to list, and a `postOnBehalf:read` would guard no route. It is its own module rather
  than `properties:write` because the route names another user as the owner of what it creates - an
  operator who can post as anyone can manufacture a listing under a consumer's name - so separating
  it lets an ops lead grant the supply console without it. Spelled `POSTONBEHALF` rather than
  `POST_ON_BEHALF` because `AccountPermissionsGuardTest` derives the `REQUIRE_` fragment
  mechanically from the wire name, and a hand-prettified constant is one the sweep cannot find.

The catalogue is a `List` rather than a `Set` because the order is part of what is served: the
grid an administrator ticks reads top to bottom, and "modules in the order they appear in the back
office, read before write" is a decision worth making once here rather than in each client. Each
entry's `adminOnly` flag is advisory to the UI and authoritative in `baselineFor` - the same field
precisely so a screen cannot offer a checkbox the server would ignore.

---

## Document vault: allowlist, sniff, scan, store

Owner-scoped by lookup, 404 never 403: every operation resolves the property through
`owner_id` first, so somebody else's paperwork is invisible on the read and a 404 on the write.
A 403 would confirm that a particular property — and therefore a particular sale deed — exists.
Personal (KYC) vault is scoped directly by `owner_id`; managed-record vault by `managed_id`.

Storage keys are server-minted: `documents/{propertyId}/{uuid}`, `personal/{ownerId}/{uuid}`,
`managed/{managedId}/{uuid}`. The client's filename is stored for display and never used as a
path, so a traversal or an overwrite of somebody else's object is impossible by construction.

**Uploaded content type is the one the bytes prove, not the one the client sent.** Every upload
runs `DocumentUploads.validate` (allowlist check on both the declared `Content-Type` and the
magic-byte sniff of the leading bytes — both must agree, both must be in the allowlist) then every
registered `DocumentScanner`, and only then calls `FileStorage.store`. The client's declared
string is used to reject and then discarded so it can never come back out as a response header.
The order is the control: a file scanned after it is stored has already been given a signed URL,
and a rejected upload that leaves an object behind is a rejected upload that can still be served.

Allowlist, never a blocklist: PDF, JPEG, PNG, HEIC. A vault serving whatever it is handed under
a Draazy-looking URL is a free hosting service for phishing pages and malware. The code does not
parse the file — a real PDF parser or image decoder would be a far larger attack surface than the
one it closes, and the threat here is a file that is not a PDF at all.

Bytes are written to the object store **before** the row: the other order leaves rows pointing
at nothing on a storage failure. Delete is a hard delete of the row; the object is left in the
store, because a delete we cannot make transactional with the row would trade a tidy bucket for
the possibility of a row pointing at a deleted object. **Exception (D190/Q15):** if the file is
the artefact behind a live Ownership Verified badge, delete refuses with 409; without this the
owner could destroy the only evidence and keep the badge. `ownership_evidence.document_id` is
`ON DELETE SET NULL` so a cited-but-lapsed badge still lets the file go, with an audit line.

Service-request files are excluded from the vault read, and from the share read, deliberately.
A service request names its property in the body and is raised by whoever needs the service, so
its `property_id` is not proof of any relationship to that listing — allowing them here would
let anyone push a file into a stranger's vault by quoting a property id. Share matching is exact
and case-insensitive, not fuzzy: `like` could only widen a grant ("Deed" pulling in "Sale Deed"
and "Mortgage Deed" alike is precisely what the owner did not share).

The service-request upload path is deliberately unscoped: `ServiceRequestService` supplies an
already-authorised `propertyId` because a staff member uploading the registered agreement does
not own the flat. Storage-key minting, allowlist and store-then-write ordering stay here rather
than being duplicated in the services context; authorisation stays where the workflow is.

## Feature-to-feature ports in the shared kernel

`package-structure.md` §5 forbids a feature context from importing another at the same or a
higher layer (`ArchitectureBoundaryTest` fails the build over it). Where two features must
communicate synchronously, an interface is declared in the shared kernel and the higher-layer
feature implements it — the arrow points down. Signatures are ids only, never entities or DTOs.

- **`OwnerBadgeSink`** — `identity` (layer 0) telling `catalog` (layer 1) that an owner's
  badge changed, so their listings can back-fill or clear the denormalised column. Synchronous
  because the write must land in the same transaction as the flag flip on the user; an event
  delivered later (or dropped) would leave a listing telling buyers the owner is verified when
  the profile no longer says so. Both directions exist: verification-earned badges are stamped
  on success, hand-granted badges are cleared when an administrator revokes them.

- **`BadgeEvidenceLookup`** — `documents` (layer 2) asking `moderation` (layer 6) whether
  a file it is about to destroy is the artefact behind an Ownership Verified badge. Rationale
  above under "Document vault".

- **`ContactGate`** — mirror-image inversion, listed here as reference for the direction rule.

## Outbound messaging: why `MessageSender` returns a `Prepared` record

`MessageSender` is the port through which this platform reaches somebody outside it (WhatsApp,
SMS, email). Same inversion as `Notifier`: contexts that need to chase an owner (moderation,
services, deals) depend on the abstraction; the implementation lives in `engagement.messaging`
below all of them. Distinct from `Notifier`, which writes an in-app inbox row for an existing
user — this reaches a person where they already are, the only channel that works for an owner
who has never signed in.

Returns `Prepared`, not a boolean, because the first implementation cannot transmit. What ships
today is WhatsApp click-to-chat: the server renders the message and hands back a `wa.me` link,
the staff member's own WhatsApp opens with the text typed out, and they press send. A boolean
would have to answer "did it go" and every honest implementation would have to answer "I don't
know". The record carries the composed body (stored as well as returned, because re-rendering
later from an edited template would show a colleague a message the owner never received), the
ledger row id, the status, and — when the transport needs a human to finish the job — the
handoff link. A count of rows means "chasers written", not "chasers delivered"; every surface
that renders one is obliged to say so. The renderer resolves `{placeholder}` keys from
`variables`; an unknown key is left standing as literal text rather than blanked, so a typo
surfaces in the preview a staff member reads instead of silently deleting a sentence.

Browser push uses a separate `PushSender` seam. The dev implementation only logs the conversation
id, and `message.received` push payloads are fixed to `Draazy`, `You have a new message`, and
`/messages?c=<id>`: no name, mobile, listing title, or message text leaves the server.
