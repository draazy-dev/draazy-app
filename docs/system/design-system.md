# Draazy Design System

## Control Sizing Scale

All interactive controls share **one height token, `--control-h`** — 40px on desktop and **44px
below 640px**. The mobile value is not decoration: 40px fails the WCAG 2.5.8 / platform 44px touch
floor, and ramping the variable fixes every dropdown trigger, dropdown option and shared field height
at once instead of per component. Quote sizes as **tokens**, never as literals.

### CSS Tokens (defined in `:root` of `src/styles/index.css`)

```css
--control-h: 40px;              /* Universal control height (44px below 640px) */
--control-font: 0.875rem;       /* 14px (text-sm) */
--control-weight: 400;          /* Regular for inputs/dropdowns */
--control-weight-action: 600;   /* Semibold for action buttons */
--control-radius: 10px;         /* Rounded square — the default for controls */
--control-radius-pill: 9999px;  /* Pill — hero search tabs, locality chips, BHK pills only */
--control-px: 1rem;             /* 16px horizontal padding */
--control-border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
--control-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
--control-bg-hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
--control-bg-active: rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.15);
--control-border-active: #14b8a6;
--control-text: #e5e7eb;        /* Selected value text */
--control-placeholder: #9ca3af; /* Placeholder text */

/* Buttons — three tiers, three sizes */
--btn-h: 40px;                  /* default (44px below 640px) */
--btn-h-sm: 32px;               /* .btn-sm (36px below 640px) */
--btn-h-lg: 48px;               /* .btn-lg */
--btn-radius, --btn-primary-grad, --btn-primary-shadow;
```

### Element Heights

Everything below derives from `--control-h` / `--btn-h`, so all of them are 40px on desktop and
44px below 640px unless stated otherwise.

| Element | Height | Class/Token | Example |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Dropdown trigger | `--control-h` | `.dz-dropdown__trigger` | "Any locality" pill |
| Dropdown option | `--control-h` | `.dz-dropdown__option` | Menu item row |
| Filter pill | `--control-h` | `.seg` or `.dz-control` | "Everyone", "Women", "Verified only" |
| Text / search input | `--control-h` | `.dz-input`, `input.form-input` | Smart search bar |
| Button (default) | `--btn-h` | `.btn` / `<Button>` | "Post", "Save search" |
| Button (small / large) | `--btn-h-sm` / `--btn-h-lg` | `.btn-sm` / `.btn-lg` | Inline action / hero CTA |
| Navbar pills | `--dz-nav-pill-h` | `.dz-topbar__pill` + `.tap-extend` | "Post Property", "Sign In" |
| Range slider | grows on touch | `.rng-wrap` / `.rng` | Budget slider (thumb 16px -> 28px) |

### Utility Classes

```
Buttons (canonical — use <Button/> from components/ui/Button.jsx)
.btn                — base (height --btn-h, radius --btn-radius, semibold)
.btn-primary        — tier 1, teal gradient. One per view.
.btn-secondary      — tier 2, outline/ghost
.btn-icon           — tier 3, square icon-only (width = height)
.btn-sm / .btn-lg   — 32px / 48px (36px / 48px below 640px)
.btn-success / .btn-danger — colour modifiers on primary
.btn-teal / .btn-outline / .dz-btn* — legacy aliases, folded into the above

Non-button controls
.dz-control{,.active,--action,--ghost} — legacy control shell, still used in the dashboard
.seg / .seg.active  — toggle/filter pill shell (height + border only)
.dz-input           — single-line text input
```

The button system in `index.css` declares itself the single source of truth for buttons; `.dz-control*`
is now the minority pattern and should not be used in new code.

### Usage in JSX

```jsx
// Primary CTA — use the component, not the classes
<Button variant="primary" icon="plus" onClick={onPost}>Post</Button>

// Secondary
<Button variant="secondary" icon="shield-check" onClick={openVerify}>Get verified</Button>

// Icon-only — `aria-label` is mandatory (see "Icon-only controls")
<Button variant="icon" iconOnly icon="rotate-ccw" aria-label="Reset filters" />

// Toggle/filter pill
<button aria-pressed={on} className={'seg px-4 h-10 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold' + (on ? ' active' : '')}>Women</button>

// Dropdown (automatic via NativeSelect/Select component)
<NativeSelect className="...">...</NativeSelect>
// Trigger height comes from --dd-trigger-height: var(--control-h).
// Below 640px Select/MultiSelect stop writing inline anchor geometry and render as bottom sheets.
```

### Typography in Controls

| Context | Weight | Color |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Dropdown selected value | 400 (regular) | `--control-text` (#e5e7eb) |
| Dropdown placeholder | 400 (regular) | `--control-placeholder` (#9ca3af) |
| Filter pill label | 600 (semibold) | gray-300 default, #5eead4 when active |
| CTA button label | 600 (semibold) | white |
| Input text | 400 (regular) | white |
| Input placeholder | 400 (regular) | gray-500 |

### Spacing Rules

- Gap between inline controls: `gap-3` (12px) or `gap-2` (8px) for tight groups
- Filter section padding: `p-4 sm:p-5`
- Label above control: `text-xs font-medium text-gray-400 mb-1.5`
- Section spacing: `space-y-6` between major cards

### Border Radius

| Element | Radius | Token |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Controls (`.dz-control`, `.seg`, `.btn*`) | `10px` | `--control-radius` |
| Text inputs (`.dz-input`) | `0.75rem` | — (literal) |
| Dropdown trigger | `999px` (pill) | `--dd-trigger-radius` |
| Pill-only exceptions (search tabs, locality chips, BHK pills) | `9999px` | `--control-radius-pill` |
| Cards | `1rem` (16px) | `--radius` / `rounded-2xl` |
| Dropdown menu | `1.1rem` | `--dd-menu-radius` |
| Menu options | `0.8rem` | `--dd-option-radius` |
| Bottom sheets (top corners) | `1.25rem` | — (literal) |
| Badges | `6px` | — |

### When NOT to use the default height

- **Category tabs** (Flatmates "Move in now" / "Team up"): built on `.seg` with `py-2.5 rounded-xl`
  and `flex-1` below `sm`, so two tabs fill a 360px row. They carry a **rendered** count badge, not
  just an `aria-label` — stock a seeker cannot see is stock they never switch tabs for.
- **Prominent / hero CTAs:** use `size="lg"` (`--btn-h-lg`, 48px), never a hand-rolled `py-*`.
- **Compact inline actions:** `.btn-sm` (`--btn-h-sm`).
- Modal footers add `pb-[calc(0.75rem + var(--dz-safe-b))]` on mobile so the primary action clears
  the home indicator.

## Mobile-first system

The app is authored mobile-first. These are the rules the phone layout depends on; breaking one of
them usually breaks a different component than the one you edited.

### Which routes are mobile-supported

"Mobile-first" is a claim about the consumer app, not about every screen in the codebase. Roughly
80% of consumer traffic is phone-only, so **every `/` consumer route is mobile-supported without
exception** and a phone regression there is a release blocker.

The back office splits in two, and the split is a deliberate scope boundary rather than an
oversight:

**Field ops — mobile-supported.** These are used standing in a lobby, on a site visit, or between
appointments, so they get the same touch-target floor, safe-area handling and content-budget checks
as consumer routes:

- `/ops` and every ops queue under it — `/ops/requests`, `/ops/flatmate-review`, `/ops/interior`,
  `/ops/legal`, `/ops/packers`, `/ops/referrals`, `/ops/rent-agreement`, `/ops/valuation`
- `/admin/properties` — listing verification, which is done with the property in front of you

**Desk admin — desktop-only, and that is a decision.** `/admin/analytics`, `/admin/finance`,
`/admin/reports`, `/admin/settings`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/team`, `/admin/staff-activity`,
`/admin/content`, `/admin/localities`, `/admin/societies`, `/admin/enquiries`, `/admin/services`,
`/admin/support`, `/admin/post-on-behalf`, `/admin/flatmates`. These are dense multi-column tables,
cross-filtered charts and bulk editors that a staff member uses seated at a desk. They must stay
*usable* on a phone — nothing may be unreachable or clipped off-screen — but they are not held to
the mobile polish bar, and time spent hand-tuning a phone layout for `/admin/analytics` is time
spent on nobody.

Practical consequences:

- Mobile e2e projects (`mobile`, `mobile-small`) cover consumer and field-ops routes. Adding a desk
  admin route to a mobile sweep will surface real but deliberately-accepted findings.
- The responsive dual-render pattern below is mandatory for field-ops tables and optional for desk
  admin, where a horizontally scrollable table is an acceptable answer.
- If a desk admin route starts being used in the field, move it into the list above *first* and then
  fix it — the list is what makes the expectation reviewable.

### Bottom chrome: `--dz-bottom-inset` and the z-index ladder
Nothing bottom-anchored may hardcode a `bottom-*` value. `--dz-bottom-inset` reports how much of the
viewport bottom is already claimed by fixed chrome; `ConsumerLayout` sets `.has-bottom-nav` on routes
that mount the mobile tab bar, which expands the inset to
`--dz-bottom-nav-h + --dz-bottom-nav-offset`. Above `lg` the variable collapses back to the
safe-area inset alone, so every `calc()` built on it resolves to the literal offset it had before the
system existed — desktop safety is structural, not a promise.

`--dz-bottom-nav-offset` is `max(--dz-bottom-nav-gap, --dz-safe-b)`, **not** a sum. The capsule's
float gap and the home-indicator inset are the same thing — breathing room at the bottom edge — so
adding them double-counts. That shipped: in an installed iOS app `--dz-safe-b` is 34px, and
`gap + safe-b` parked the bar 46px above the screen edge (5.5% of the viewport) while an in-browser
visit showed the intended 12px, because in a browser tab the inset is 0. It is one token because the
bar's own `bottom` and `--dz-bottom-inset` must agree; they were two hand-synced `calc()`s, which is
precisely how they drifted apart.

The ladder is written down once so bottom chrome never re-negotiates it:
**content 0-49 · sticky page CTA 60 · mobile bottom nav 70 · autosave flash 90 · sheets 1000 ·
assistant 1300 · install prompt 1350 · cookie consent 1400 · blocking modals 1500 · toasts 1600.**

Toasts are the top of the *bottom-chrome* ladder on purpose, and they are the one rung there that is
not bottom chrome. A toast is the receipt for an action the user just took — "Saved", "Request sent",
"Couldn't copy link" — so it has to be legible above whatever surface triggered it, including a modal.
Anything that outranked a toast would silently swallow the only confirmation the app gives. That is
also why the container is `pointer-events: none` with the pills re-enabling it individually: sitting
at 1600 means it covers real estate on every layer below, so it must not intercept a tap meant for
them.

The rung this replaced is worth recording. The autosave pill used to sit at an undocumented
`z-index: 2000` — above blocking modals — so a transient "Draft saved" could paint over a dialog
asking the user to confirm something irreversible. It is now 90, because it reports *state* rather
than confirming an *action* and never needs to outrank a dialog. A property lightbox carried the same
ad-hoc 2000 and has been moved onto the 1500 modal rung for the same reason.

**Above the ladder there is a second, higher band that the ladder above does not describe**, and it
is recorded here so nobody assumes 1600 is the ceiling:

| Layer | Value | Why it is up there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.dz-lightbox`, `.dz-dropdown__scrim` | 9998 | Must cover page chrome including the sticky nav |
| `.dz-dropdown__menu--sheet`, `.dz-action-sheet` | 9999 | Paired with the scrim directly beneath them |
| `.dz-cal` (date picker) | 2000 | Anchored dropdown that has to clear the sheet it opens inside |
| Skip-to-content link | 9999 | WCAG 2.4.1 — on focus it must beat everything |
| Maintenance overlay | 99999 | Blocks the entire consumer app by design |

The skip link and the maintenance overlay genuinely belong at the ceiling. The sheet/picker cluster
is the **known inconsistency**: `.dz-action-sheet` at 9999 outranks the toast layer at 1600, so a
confirmation fired from inside an action sheet paints behind it. Consolidating that cluster onto the
1000 "sheets" rung is the next change here; it is called out rather than done silently because
restacking live surfaces changes real tap and focus behaviour and needs its own measurement pass.

Every `position: fixed` addition gets a rung — from this page, not invented — before it ships. A
value picked to "just be on top" is how 2000 happened, twice.

The autosave flash (`.dz-autosave-flash`) sits *just above* the tab bar rather than near the top:
it reports state and never needs to outrank a dialog. It is also the one piece of bottom chrome
appended to `<body>` rather than rendered inside the layout, so it cannot read the
`--dz-bottom-inset` that `.has-bottom-nav` sets on ConsumerLayout's wrapper — it rebuilds the
offset from `--dz-bottom-nav-h` + `--dz-bottom-nav-offset` inside the bar's own breakpoint
instead. Anything else appended to `<body>` has the same blind spot.

A new `position: fixed` element must be checked against the existing bottom-chrome inventory (bottom
nav, assistant FAB, install prompt, cookie bar, CityChrome, sticky CTA), not just against z-index — two
floating controls on the same corner intercept each other's taps.

The ConnectivityBanner at 1450 is the one rung on that ladder that is *top* chrome, deliberately. The
bottom edge of a phone viewport already carries five fixed layers, and a sixth at 360px would sit on
the floating tab bar or its raised centre FAB; docked to `--dz-top-inset` it cannot cover either,
structurally rather than by promise. It outranks the cookie card because a first-visit consent prompt
must never be the reason a dropped connection goes unexplained, and sits under blocking modals
because a dialog already owns the screen while it is up.

The tab bar is a floating capsule rather than an edge-to-edge bar because an edge-to-edge bar reads as
a wall while a detached capsule reads as a control sitting on the page — which is what lets the page
scroll visibly under and around it. The material is one blur plus one `saturate()` boost plus a light
inset top edge, not a stack of decorations: `saturate()` is what stops the blur turning the app's teal
into grey mud. Its fill is tinted with `--indigo-1`/teal rather than neutral grey so it reads as Draazy
chrome next to the teal Post button, and the alphas (0.74/0.86) are set by the worst case — a gallery
or a reel can put near-white imagery directly behind it, and a lighter fill left the labels on
mid-grey. Without `backdrop-filter` (Firefox Android, older WebViews) the capsule falls back to an
opaque fill; a translucent one there is just unreadable text over content.

### Top chrome: `--dz-nav-h`, `--dz-top-inset`, hide-on-scroll
`--dz-nav-h` is the only place the top bar's height is written down: the row, every page's top
padding, sticky sub-headers and full-height routes all derive from it (58px on phones, 72px from
768px up). `--dz-top-inset` is where a sticky sub-header docks; below `lg` the navbar slides away on
scroll-down (`.dz-nav-hidden` on `<html>`) and the inset drops to 0 so the sub-header rises to the
screen edge instead of leaving a hole. Opt a sub-header in with `.dz-docks-under-nav`. Every rule
that reacts to the class lives inside a `max-width: 1023.98px` block, so the class is inert on
desktop.

### Bottom sheets are the mobile overlay shape
Below 640px a centred dialog is the wrong shape: with the keyboard open the usable viewport is ~300px,
so a form modal's submit button leaves the screen. Every centred overlay therefore docks to the bottom
edge as a sheet — squared bottom corners, `1.25rem` top corners, `max-height` in `dvh`, a slide-in, a
36x4px grab handle, and bottom padding that adds `--dz-safe-b`. Four shells implement it and must not
diverge:

- `.dz-modal` / `.dz-modal-backdrop` — all legacy consumer overlays, converted by **one media query
  with zero markup edits**. Look for the shared class before editing a component.
- `.dz-modal-sheet` — the shared `<Modal>`.
- `.dz-dropdown__menu--sheet` + `.dz-dropdown__scrim` — `Select`/`MultiSelect` stop writing inline
  anchor geometry below `sm`.
- `.dz-action-sheet` — overflow menus.

`useSwipeDismiss` adds drag-to-dismiss; it arms only on the mobile media query, only inside the top
40px handle zone, and takes pointer capture on the first qualifying *move* — capturing on
`pointerdown` retargets the following click and breaks every button in the panel.

**The shared `<Modal>` sits at `z-[1550]`, inside the floating-chrome band**, and the trap is that
the collision only exists below 640px. On desktop the panel is centred while the passive chrome
(CityChrome 1200, AssistantWidget 1300, InstallPrompt 1350, CookieConsent 1400, ConnectivityBanner
1450, MobileNav 1500) is pinned to an edge; as a bottom sheet the two share one strip, and a *short*
sheet lands its buttons under the cookie banner outright. Anything below that band also has its
clicks swallowed by the `pointer-events-auto` panels in it. A modal is the foreground task, so it
outranks passive chrome — but it stays **below** `ToastContext`'s 1600, because a toast is how the
modal's own action reports back. The portalled `Select`/`Menu` popovers set `zIndex = 9999` inline
and are unaffected, which is what keeps a dropdown usable inside a dialog.

Structurally, the sheet's header/body/footer become a bounded flex column so the body scrolls
internally and the footer actions stay pinned above the keyboard. Every mobile value is a base class
paired with an `sm:` reset, so at ≥640px the rendered class set is the plain desktop one.

### Touch-target floor: `.tap-target` vs `.tap-extend`
Two classes, one rule (WCAG 2.5.8 / 44px). `.tap-target` grows the box
(`min-width`/`min-height: 44px`) and is for icon-only controls whose box is invisible chrome anyway.
`.tap-extend` keeps the drawn size and lays a transparent 44px `::before` under the finger — use it
wherever the *drawn* size is load-bearing (a close pill on a small bubble; the top-bar pills, which
drop to `--dz-nav-pill-h` / `--dz-nav-icon-box` below `sm` so four painted 44px boxes don't overflow a
360px bar). **Never pair the two on one element:** they set the same property and `.tap-target` is
declared later, so pairing silently reinstates the 44px box. A 32px box plus the row's 12px gap puts
adjacent centres exactly 44px apart — do not shrink the gap without shrinking the target.

### Icon-only controls must carry a real accessible name
`title=` is **not** a label on touch — it never surfaces on a phone, so an icon-only control named
only by `title` is unnamed. Every icon-only button takes `aria-label`, and toggles take
`aria-pressed`. Where a visible label is dropped for space (bottom-nav tabs in landscape), the
`aria-label` is set unconditionally so hiding the text costs a screen reader nothing. Grep for
`title=` on icon-only buttons during any mobile pass.

### Hover is not an affordance
Nothing may be reachable only via `:hover`; on a touch screen that state never fires and the content
is simply invisible. Mark any hover-revealed layer `.reveal-on-hover` and it becomes permanently
visible under `@media (hover: none)` — keyed on the *capability*, not the viewport, so touch laptops
are covered and mouse desktops keep the animation. The same block removes the browser's blue tap
flash and replaces it with an `:active` opacity dip: removing one without the other makes taps feel
broken.

### Sticky action rows (`position: sticky`, not `fixed`)
In-flow action rows use `sticky`: the row keeps its place in the flow, so it reserves its own space
and can never cover the last field — no per-step `padding-bottom` bookkeeping. Three consumers:
`.lp-step-actions` (listing wizard, below `lg`, primary flexed 1.6x so the target is unambiguous
under a thumb), `.dz-auth-submit` (sign-in/sign-up, where the keyboard would otherwise push the
primary action below the fold), and `.dz-sticky-cta`, which is genuinely `fixed` and docks at
`--dz-bottom-inset`.

### Mobile bottom nav + the floating-glass material
The primary wayfinding surface on phones is a floating capsule, not an edge-to-edge bar: an
edge-to-edge bar reads as a wall, a detached capsule reads as a control sitting on the page. The
material is one blur + one saturation boost + a light inset top edge, tinted with the app's own
indigo/teal — `saturate()` is what stops the blur turning the brand teal into grey mud. Alphas are set
by the worst case (near-white gallery imagery behind the bar), not the pretty one. Both users of the
material (`.dz-bottom-nav`, `.filter-fab`) share the same `left` inset so they sit on one vertical
edge, and both carry an opaque `@supports not (backdrop-filter)` fallback for Firefox Android and old
WebViews. Height is owned by `--dz-bottom-nav-h` **only** — an inline `style` on the element would
desync every widget that positions against `--dz-bottom-inset`.

### Home-screen install nudge is two mechanisms, not one
`InstallPrompt.jsx` promotes adding Draazy to the home screen, and the platform split is real
rather than an implementation detail worth hiding:

- **Chromium** (Android Chrome, Samsung Internet, Edge) fires `beforeinstallprompt`. We
  `preventDefault()` it — suppressing Chrome's own mini-infobar so the user gets one ask, not two —
  stash the event, and call `prompt()` from the click. That opens the browser's native install
  dialog. `prompt()` throws outside a user gesture, so a silent install on page load is impossible on
  every platform, by design.
- **iOS/WebKit** has no install API in any browser, including Chrome on iOS. The only honest option
  is the Share → Add to Home Screen instruction, rendered **without** a button — a CTA there would be
  a dead control.
- Everything else (Firefox Android, desktop) never renders it. Mobile-only via `lg:hidden`, matching
  the bottom nav's breakpoint.

**The gate is engagement, not time.** The nudge appears after 3 page views, not after N seconds: a
timer measures patience, whereas three pages in is someone who came here to look at homes. The count
persists in `localStorage` (`dz_install_prompt_v1`), so it accumulates across visits.

**Silence escalates and is terminal:** 1st dismissal → 1 week, 2nd → 2 weeks, 3rd → never again.
Declining the browser's own dialog counts as a dismissal; treating it as neutral would re-ask someone
who already said no. It is also suppressed while the cookie bar is up (that bar is legally required
and owns the bottom of the screen), and never shown once `display-mode: standalone`,
`navigator.standalone`, or an `appinstalled` event indicates the app is already installed.

> The view counter is written through a ref guard. Under `StrictMode` effects are double-invoked
> deliberately, and a bare `views + 1` counted every page twice — the gate opened at half the intended
> engagement in dev. Any future per-navigation counter has the same trap.

### Landscape phones are a height budget, not a width one
A rotated handset is ~915x412, so a `min-width: 768px` breakpoint cannot tell it from a tablet and was
serving it desktop chrome on a 412px-tall screen. When a rule is really about available *height*, key
it off height and orientation. The landscape block is guarded three ways — `orientation: landscape`
**and** `max-height: 500px` **and** `max-width: 1023.98px` — so a 1440x900 desktop and a 1024x768
landscape tablet both fail it structurally. Inside it `--dz-nav-h` drops to 47px,
`--dz-bottom-nav-h` to 44px, and tab labels are hidden (the `aria-label` keeps the tab named).

### Safe areas and `dvh`
`viewport-fit=cover` is set on the document — the only thing that makes `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
resolve to real values. Bottom insets flow through `--dz-safe-b`, never through raw `env()` at call
sites. Horizontal insets are handled by `.dz-safe-x` (positioning, not padding, so the element's own
padding utilities survive); `env()` is `0px` everywhere else including desktop, so the class is inert
off-device.

Every viewport-height constraint uses **`dvh`**, so the mobile URL bar collapsing does not resize the
layout: dropdown/action sheets cap at `70dvh`, modals at `88dvh`, the app shell is `min-h-[100dvh]`.
Do not introduce `vh`.

### Responsive dual-render (mobile card / desktop table)
Data tables render twice: a stacked card list at `sm:hidden` and the real `<table>` at
`hidden sm:block`. `Table` takes an optional `mobileCard(row)` renderer and only splits when one is
supplied, so a table without one is unchanged. **Both copies exist in the DOM at all times** — any
assertion or query selector must scope to the visible copy (`getByRole('table')`, `:visible`), or it
hits the hidden one first.

### Mobile vertical rhythm and type
- The page rhythm was authored for a 1440px canvas, where 40px between sections reads as air; on a
  412px screen it is most of a fold. Two knobs, not per-component tuning: `--section-gap` (already
  behind every `.section-y/-pt/-pb/-mb`) drops to `1.75rem` below `sm`, and `--section-head-gap`
  standardises the gap under a section heading.
- `.consumer-main` headings scale down exactly 20% below 640px, scoped to `h1/h2/h3` so numeric price
  and stat spans reusing the same `text-*` utilities keep their emphasis.
- **Never let an editable field's font-size fall below 16px on touch.** Touch browsers zoom into any
  field under 16px on focus, forcing the user to pinch back out; our controls run 13-14px, so every
  `input`/`select`/`textarea` is lifted to `16px !important` under `pointer: coarse`. The
  `!important` is required to beat class-scoped rules.
- A `px` font-size is not "safe" from dynamic type — it *is* the accessibility failure. Labels that
  must scale are authored in `rem` with an overflow guard, and never with `leading-none` (line-height
  1 is shorter than ascent+descent and clips glyphs).

### Reduced motion is a first-class state
Decorative motion is cut under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, and the app additionally honours a
user-toggled "Reduce motion" setting mirroring the OS one. What survives is the half that carries
information: the bottom-nav indicator keeps its opacity fade but loses its travel; the filter FAB
keeps its shadow drop but loses the press scale; sheets keep a short opacity transition instead of the
slide. When cutting motion, ask which half of the effect reports state.

### Devanagari typography
The interface is English-only, but user-written text (listing descriptions, society names, a Marathi
rent-agreement deed) can still be Devanagari. `--font-sans` lists `'Noto Sans Devanagari'` **after**
`Outfit`, not instead of it: the browser falls through per character, so Latin still renders in Outfit
and only Devanagari codepoints reach Noto, whose subsets are behind `unicode-range` so an English
visitor never downloads them. Putting Noto first would restyle the entire site.

### Route-scoped stylesheets
Large per-route CSS is split out of `index.css` and ships with its route chunk instead of blocking
first paint everywhere: `styles/routes/{messages,reels,flatmates,rent-agreement,property-map,compare,services-hub}.css`.
`index.css` keeps a one-line pointer at each extraction site. New route-only styling belongs in a
route file, not in `index.css`.

### Shared primitives inventory
Reach for these before hand-rolling (`src/components/ui/`): `Button` (3 tiers, 3 sizes, `to`/`as`
polymorphism), `Modal` (portal, focus trap, stacked-dialog-aware Escape, sheet on mobile), `Table`
(pagination, selection, optional `mobileCard`), `Select` / `MultiSelect` / `NativeSelect` /
`LocalitySelect`, `DateField` / `TimeField` / `DatePickerDialog` / `TimePickerDialog` (all bottom
sheets on phones), `Menu` (action sheet on phones), `MobileCollapse` (collapsed below `lg`, always
open above — an overlay toggle, so existing heading markup is untouched), `HScroll` (horizontal rail
with edge fades; its arrow buttons are 36px and are *removed* under `pointer: coarse` rather than
grown), `Tabs`, `Switch`, `Badge`, `Tip`, `FieldError`, `DualRange`, `Stat`, `PageHeader`,
`PoweredByGoogle`.

## Control Width

A control's width should reflect the content it holds, not the width of the page.
A dropdown or text input that stretches edge-to-edge for a handful of short
options reads as a page-wide bar and makes the form feel unfinished.

**Rule:** dropdowns and short inputs must not span the full form width on desktop.

- **Grid-paired controls** — keep `w-full` so they fill their grid cell. Two
  half-width controls sharing a row (e.g. Facing + Age, Property Type + BHK) is
  the preferred layout: it fills the row without any single control stretching.
- **Standalone controls** — a control that is the only field in its row must be
  capped. In the Post-a-property flow use the `ddSolo` token
  (`sm:max-w-xs`, from `list-property/styles.js`); elsewhere apply an equivalent
  `sm:max-w-xs`/`sm:max-w-sm` cap. It stays full-width on mobile for easy tapping
  and caps to ~half a row on desktop.
- **Wide-content controls** — a searchable locality list or a free-text address
  legitimately needs more room; let those fill their cell. The cap is for short,
  fixed option sets (zone, water source, unit, tenure).

```jsx
// ✅ Standalone dropdown — capped so it doesn't span the page
<Select className={ddSolo} value={form.waterSource} onChange={...} options={waterSourceOptions} />

// ✅ Paired dropdowns — each fills half the row
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Select value={form.facing} ... />
  <Select value={form.age} ... />
</div>

// ❌ Standalone dropdown left full-width for a short option list
<Select value={form.waterSource} ... />
```

### Design validation checklist

Before shipping a form, confirm:

- [ ] No dropdown with a short, fixed option set spans the full form width on desktop.
- [ ] Standalone dropdowns/inputs are capped (`ddSolo` / `sm:max-w-xs`) or paired into a grid row.
- [ ] Every interactive control derives its height from a token (`--control-h`, `--btn-h`,
      `--btn-h-sm`, `--btn-h-lg`) — never a literal `h-*`.
- [ ] No control drops below 44px at <640px; verify at **360px**, not just at desktop width.
- [ ] Grid-paired controls share the row evenly (`sm:grid-cols-2`), no lone stretched cell.
- [ ] Every icon-only control has an `aria-label` (a `title` is not a label on touch).
- [ ] Nothing bottom-anchored hardcodes a `bottom-*` value — it docks at `--dz-bottom-inset` and was
      checked against the existing bottom-chrome inventory.
- [ ] Any new overlay uses one of the four sheet shells rather than a fifth.
- [ ] No `vh` — viewport heights are `dvh`.

## How to Apply to a New Page

1. Use `<Button>` for every button; pick the tier (`primary` / `secondary` / `icon`) and, if needed,
   the size (`sm` / `lg`). Do not hand-roll `py-*` heights.
2. Use `<NativeSelect>` or `<Select>` for dropdowns — they take their height from `--control-h` and
   become bottom sheets below 640px automatically.
3. Use the `seg()` helper or `.seg` for toggle/filter pills.
4. Use `.dz-input` or `input.form-input` for text/search inputs — both take their height from
   `--control-h`. Do not hand-tune vertical padding (`py-[9px]`); it desyncs from the mobile 44px ramp.
5. Wrap sliders in `.rng-wrap` / `.rng` rather than a bare `h-10` row. On `pointer: coarse` the thumb
   grows 16px -> 28px and the row grows with it, so a fixed `h-10` wrapper clips it.
6. Put route-only CSS in `styles/routes/<route>.css`, not in `index.css`.
7. Verify at 360px wide **and** in landscape (~915x412) before calling it done.
