/**
 * HTTP lead-note provider.
 *
 * No mapper module alongside this one: the server's `LeadNoteResponse` was designed against this
 * seam and the field names already match, so a mapper here would be a file of identity functions.
 * The one shape difference worth naming is that `followUpAt` and `updatedAt` arrive as ISO strings
 * rather than epoch millis. Nothing is converted here,
 * because both of the panel's consumers (`FollowUpChip`, the sheet's date input) go through helpers
 * that already accept either, and a conversion in this file would be a second place for the two
 * representations to disagree.
 *
 * Nothing in this file names an owner. The store is caller-scoped, derived from the token, which is
 * what lets both calls take no owner argument — and is what keeps the notes with the account rather
 * than with one browser.

/**
 * Epoch millis → ISO-8601, because the two are not interchangeable on the wire even though every
 * *reader* in this app treats them as if they were.
 *
 * `LeadSheet` produces `new Date(v).getTime()` — a number — and the server's field is an `Instant`,
 * which Jackson reads a bare JSON number into as epoch **seconds**. So a millisecond value posted
 * raw lands about fifty thousand years out. Measured, not assumed: the endpoint answers
 * `400 bad_request` — "followUpAt is too far from today to be a date anyone meant to pick" — so the
 * service's own range guard catches it rather than storing the nonsense. That guard is why this is
 * a failed save the owner sees a toast for, rather than a corrupt row nobody notices; it is not a
 * reason to skip the conversion, because without it no follow-up date can ever be saved at all.
 *
 * Converted here rather than in the sheet because this is the only layer that owes the server a
 * representation; the sheet's number is fine everywhere else.
 *
 * Strings pass through untouched — a caller echoing a row back from a previous read is already
 * sending ISO, and re-parsing it would be a second place for the formats to disagree.
