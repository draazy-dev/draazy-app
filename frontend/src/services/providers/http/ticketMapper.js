/**
 * Wire `Ticket` ⇄ the ops board's view model.
 *
 * The board is `OpsQueue`, rendered by `/ops/requests`. Three of its words are wrong rather than
 * merely different, which is why this file exists at all instead of the provider passing
 * `TicketDto` straight through.
 *
 * ## `assignedTo` is a name on the way in and an id on the way out
 *
 * `TicketDto.assignee` is already resolved to a **display name** server-side (`TicketMapper` looks
 * the user up), so the read needs no work. The write is the asymmetric half: `TicketUpdate` takes
 * an `assigneeId`, and `TicketService.update` answers an id that does not resolve to an ops user
 * with a 404 — "assigning work to somebody who does not exist is a mistake, not a preference".
 * `updateTicket(id, { assignedTo: user.name })` therefore cannot work at all; a name is not an id
 * and no amount of mapping makes it one. `toClaim` takes the caller's own id and nothing else.
 *
 * ## The status vocabulary is the server's
 *
 * `TicketStatuses` knows five words (`open`, `in-progress`, `waiting`, `resolved`, `closed`) and
 * the board adopts all five, so this mapper does **not** translate. Collapsing any of them would
 * make a ticket parked on a customer look
 * identical to one nobody has picked up. The one thing it does is normalise `in_progress` to
 * `in-progress` on the way out, because that underscore is spelled into old fixtures and query
 * strings and a silent 400 is a poor way to find out.
 *
 * ## Notes are not a field you write
 *
 * `TicketDto.notes` is readable and `TicketUpdate` has no `notes` member, because appending is a
 * `POST /{id}/notes`. Read-modify-writing the whole array is how two people taking notes on the
 * same ticket lose one of them. Not mapped, not writable, and `toNote` exists only to give the
 * append response the shape the list is already rendering.
