/**
 * Wire → view-model translation for the note domain, and the one place `listing` becomes `property`.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary bridge
 *
 * Every note call site in this app says `listing`. The contract says `property` — as it does in
 * `/properties`, in `ReportTargetTypes`, in `PropertyResponse`. Both words are defensible and
 * neither is going to move, so the translation happens here, once, rather than at forty call sites
 * or by teaching the API a second client's noun.
 *
 * `toWireType` is deliberately a *whitelist* and not a `listing → property` string swap with a
 * pass-through default. A typo would otherwise sail through to the server, which refuses unknown
 * kinds with a 400 — a clear failure, but one raised a network round trip away from the mistake.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * The wire note is `{id, entityType, entityId, authorId, authorName, action, text, createdAt,
 * updatedAt}`; the view model is `{id, author, action, text, at, editedAt}` — the shape the
 * `InternalNote` widget and the Communication Log already render.
 *
 * `author` falls back to `authorId` because a byline with an ugly id in it is a fact; a blank
 * byline reads as "the system did this".
 *
 * `editedAt` is null when the note has never been corrected. The server sets `updatedAt` on insert
 * as well as on update, so "has this been edited?" is `updatedAt > createdAt` rather than
 * `updatedAt != null` — presence would mark every note as edited the moment it was written.
