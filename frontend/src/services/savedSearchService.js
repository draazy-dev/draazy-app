/**
 * Saved Search Service — persisted searches and their alert preferences.
 *
 * ## Two shape gaps this seam absorbs
 *
 * **1. Flat facets vs a nested `filters` object.** The whole app reads a saved search's facets
 * directly off the record — `criteriaChips(rec)` and the alert card both do `rec.deal`, `rec.bhk`,
 * `rec.localities`. The server nests them under a free-form `filters` jsonb column instead. Rather
 * than rewrite every consumer to reach one level deeper, the provider flattens `filters` back onto
 * the record on read and re-nests it on write. The seam's shape is the flat one, because that is
 * the shape the UI is written against.
 *
 * **2. `alerts` boolean vs `alertFrequency` enum.** The server has `off | instant | daily |
 * weekly`. Both are exposed here: `alertFrequency` is the real field and `alerts` is derived from
 * it (`alertFrequency !== 'off'`) for the read-only places that only need to know whether a search
 * is being watched — the dashboard's "3 active" count, the stat card.
 *
 * Nothing *writes* through the boolean. The dashboard's alert row is a four-option cadence
 * picker and writes `alertFrequency` directly, so a user holding `instant` who turns alerts off and
 * on again gets `instant` back. A two-state helper would write `daily` on every switch-on, which is
 * harmless only for as long as no cadence other than `daily` is reachable. `ALERT_FREQUENCIES`
 * below is the enum, in escalating order, and is the one place it is spelled.
 *
 * ## Kinds
 *
 * A saved search watches one of two surfaces. `kind: 'listings'` carries a `query` string and
 * `filters`; `kind: 'flatmates'` carries a `criteria` object and no query. The server enforces
 * "listings needs query, flatmates needs criteria" in both Bean Validation and a CHECK constraint.
 *
 * ## Two counts, both read-only
 *
 * `newCount` is what arrived since the alert sweep's last baseline; it falls back to zero once the
 * alert has been sent, so it is a "what changed" number, not a total. `matchCount` is how many live
 * listings fit the facets right now, regardless of age. Callers must not derive either one:
 * the browser can only ever see a page of the catalogue, which is precisely the defect `matchCount`
 * closes. Both are always 0 for a `flatmates` alert — neither count reads the rooms
 * catalogue.
