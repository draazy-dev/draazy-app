      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your access to and use of draazy.com and associated
        applications (the "<strong>Platform</strong>")         operated by Draazy Technologies
                ("<strong>Draazy</strong>", "we", "us").
      </p>
      <p>
        By registering an account or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree,
        please do not use the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old and competent to enter into a binding contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.</li>
        <li>If you represent a company or partnership firm, you confirm you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Account and verification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your OTP and login credentials.</li>
        <li>Identity verification is optional. Property owners may publish listings without it; completing it earns a Verified badge and is required only to reach owners who accept verified contacts only.</li>
        <li>Draazy may suspend or terminate accounts that fail verification or violate these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Platform services</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Property marketplace</h3>
      <p>
        Draazy is an intermediary platform that connects property owners, buyers, and tenants. We do not own, manage,
        or guarantee any property listed on the Platform. All transactions are between the parties directly.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Ancillary services</h3>
      <p>
        We facilitate access to third-party services including home loans, legal assistance, packers &amp; movers, rent
        agreements, interior renovation, and property valuation through verified partners. Draazy acts as a facilitator
        and is not a party to the underlying service contract between you and the partner.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 No brokerage</h3>
      <p>
        Draazy does not charge brokerage or commission from buyers or tenants for property transactions. Revenue is
        generated through Listing Passes, Contact Packs, rent agreements, and referral fees from service partners.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User obligations</h2>
      <p>When using the Platform, you agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post false, misleading, or fraudulent property listings or personal details.</li>
        <li>Use the Platform for any unlawful purpose or in violation of RERA, 2016 or other applicable laws.</li>
        <li>Scrape, crawl, or use automated tools to extract data from the Platform.</li>
        <li>Harass, threaten, or defame other users.</li>

        by Draazy or its licensors and protected under the Copyright Act, 1957 and the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
        You grant Draazy a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to display, distribute, and promote content
        you upload (photos, descriptions) for the purpose of operating the Platform. This licence terminates when you

      </p>

      <h2>7. Payments</h2>

        <li>Listing Passes, Contact Packs and rent agreements are one-off purchases, paid in advance. There are no subscriptions and nothing renews automatically.</li>
        <li>Prices include GST. Rent agreements cost extra only for government charges (stamp duty and registration).</li>
        <li>A Listing Pass ends early when its listing is rented, sold or archived; unused days are not refunded.</li>
        <li>Refunds are governed by our <Link to="/refund-policy">Refund Policy</Link>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Draazy shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential,
        or punitive damages arising from your use of the Platform, including but not limited to:
      </p>

        preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or INR 10,000, whichever is higher.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Draazy, its officers, directors, and employees from any claims,

        third-party rights.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Dispute resolution</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>These Terms are governed by the laws of India.</li>
        <li>Any dispute shall first be referred to mediation in Pune. If unresolved within 30 days, the dispute shall be referred to binding arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, with a sole arbitrator appointed mutually.</li>
        <li>The courts of Pune shall have exclusive jurisdiction for any proceedings ancillary to arbitration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>11. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at any time, with or without cause, upon reasonable notice.
        Upon termination, your right to use the Platform ceases immediately. Clauses that by their nature should survive
        (indemnification, limitation of liability, dispute resolution) shall survive termination.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be notified via email or in-app notification at
        least 15 days before they take effect. Your continued use of the Platform after the effective date constitutes
        acceptance of the revised Terms.
