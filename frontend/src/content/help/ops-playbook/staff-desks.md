## Daily checklist

**Monitor**

- **Waiting for you** tiles ? a number in amber means work is open on that desk.
- The **Oldest ?** line on each tile ? the tile with the oldest item goes first.
- **All clear** is the only empty state. If the dashboard says it could not load, reload; do not assume nothing is waiting.
- Managers and admins: **SLA health** shows work finished on time ? green at 90% or more, amber 75?89%, rose below 75%, plus a **late now** count.

**Work on**

- Open the tile with the oldest waiting item and follow its runbook from the table below.
- Managers and admins: clear the **Pending Verification**, **Needs Follow-up**, **Flagged Listings** and **Open Reports** tiles.
- No tile, or "No work is assigned to you yet"? Ask your manager to grant a function in **Team & Access**.

## One back office

Staff, managers and admins share one back office. Managers and admins open it at `/admin`; staff open the same pages under `/staff/…`. Old `/ops/…` bookmarks redirect to the matching `/admin/…` page.

What you see depends on the **functions** you hold (KYC review, Property verification, Listing moderation, Post on behalf, Flatmates, Support, Reports, Referrals, Societies, Content, Analytics, and one per service desk). A staff member with no function sees the dashboard only. Admins see everything; managers also see every service desk. If a desk you need is missing, ask your manager or an admin to grant the function in **Team & Access** (`/admin/team`, manager and admin only) — do not borrow a colleague's login. New staff activate from an invite link at `/staff-invite`.

## Rules for every desk

- Work the oldest item in the queue first unless a runbook says a risk queue goes first.
- Record why you decided, not just what — the next reviewer reads your note, not your mind.
- Never decide a case you raised, approved or claimed yourself where the runbook asks for a second person.
- Never move a case to WhatsApp, personal email or chat; keep it on the desk.
- When a desk fails to load, treat the queue as unknown, not empty, and escalate.
