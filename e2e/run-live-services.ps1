# Runs the live Playwright suite for the SERVICES lane: app on :5191, API on :8096,
# database draazy_e2e_sv2. The backend for this lane must already be running via
# backend/run-lane-services.ps1 (-DbuildDirName=target-sv2, --server.port=8096,
# profiles local,e2e).
#
# WHY A SCRIPT. The three settings below have to agree with the backend launcher, and a
# -g pattern contains '|' and quotes, both of which PowerShell 5.1 eats before npx ever
# sees them. Passing the arguments through an array avoids the escaping entirely.
#
# Usage:
#   .\run-live-services.ps1 tests/consumer/services/referral-rewards.spec.js
#   .\run-live-services.ps1 tests/consumer/services -Grep 'quota'
#
# Pure ASCII on purpose: PowerShell 5.1 parses a BOM-less UTF-8 .ps1 as cp1252.
