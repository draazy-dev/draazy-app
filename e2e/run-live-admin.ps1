# Runs the live Playwright suite for the ADMIN lane: app on :5182, API on :8084,

#
# WHY A SCRIPT. The three settings below have to agree with the backend launcher, and a
# -g pattern contains '|' and quotes, both of which PowerShell 5.1 eats before npx ever
# sees them. Passing the arguments through an array avoids the escaping entirely.
#
# Usage:
#   .\run-live-admin.ps1 tests/admin/properties-console.spec.js
#   .\run-live-admin.ps1 tests/admin/notes.spec.js -Grep 'a note lands'
#
# Pure ASCII on purpose: PowerShell 5.1 parses a BOM-less UTF-8 .ps1 as cp1252.

# of running anything.
