/**
 * Contract schema {@code Message}.
 *
 * @param authorId   who wrote it — <strong>the field a client must use to decide "mine or theirs"</strong>.
 *     {@link #author} is a display name, and attributing by name works right up until two users
 *     share one, at which point a stranger's message renders on the reader's own side of the thread.
 *     Added 2026-08-08: the mapper already read this id to look up the name and then discarded it,
 *     so the contract declared a field the wire never carried (found by {@code SpecSchemaParityTest}).
 * @param author     display name; {@code null} for a message whose author has since been removed
 * @param authorRole {@code buyer|owner|staff|manager|admin}, captured at write time
 * @param readAt     when the other side of the thread first opened it, or {@code null} if they have
 *     not (D121). Before this the unread badge was computed in {@code localStorage}, so it cleared
 *     on one browser and stayed lit on the rest — and the sender learnt nothing either way.
