/**
 * Which ops desk a caller may act for, and which requests that lets them touch (D44).
 *
 * <p>Extracted from {@link ServiceRequestService} rather than left beside the flows that use it,
 * because it is the whole of one rule and none of any other: every method here is a total function
 * of the caller and the thing being reached for, with no repository, no clock and no transaction.
 * That makes the rule readable in one screen and testable without a request ever being created —
 * which is the point, since the failure mode it guards against is silent over-permission rather
 * than a thrown exception somebody would notice.
 *
 * <p><strong>The rule, in one line: an absent desk is a refusal, never a wildcard.</strong> Both
 * methods below could have been written to let a deskless staff account through, and both would
 * then have granted that account strictly more than a desked colleague — every desk's work instead
 * of one desk's. That inversion is the mistake a team filter makes by accident, so it is spelled
 * out twice here and pinned by {@code PermissionMapGuardTest.teamlessStaffKeepTheRoleBaseline}.
 *
 * <p>Stateless and side-effect free; the methods are static for that reason.
