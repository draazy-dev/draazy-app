/**
 * A single-use invite that lets one back-office colleague set their own password. Maps
 * {@code staff_invites} (V71, tech debt D206).
 *
 * <p><strong>What it is for.</strong> The create form once carried a {@code password} field, so the
 * creator chose the credential the new account would sign in with. A row here means the account has
 * no usable password and cannot authenticate until the human it belongs to redeems the token and
 * chooses one. The raw token is returned once to the creator and never stored in plain text.
 *
 * <p><strong>Only the digest of the secret is stored.</strong> The token given to the invitee is
 * {@code <id>.<secret>}: the id is a selector that fetches exactly this row, and the secret is
 * verified with {@link java.security.MessageDigest#isEqual} — see {@link StaffInviteService}. A dump
 * of this table is therefore not replayable, on the same reasoning as {@code refresh_tokens} and
 * {@code otp_codes}.
 *
 * <p>No setters. {@link #redeem()} is the only mutation, it is one-way, and it refuses a second
 * call — single use is the property this class exists to be, and a setter would hand it away.
