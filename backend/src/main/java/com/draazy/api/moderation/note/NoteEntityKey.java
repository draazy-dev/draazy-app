/**
 * Collapses the two identifiers a listing answers to into the one key a note is stored under.
 *
 * <h2>The bug this exists to make impossible</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code entity_id} is {@code text} and was stored exactly as the client sent it. A listing has
 * two public identifiers — its slug ({@code p5145}) and its uuid — and the contract accepts either
 * on every {@code /properties/{id}} route, so both were arriving here. The console's note widget
 * sends the slug, because the client's {@code propertyMapper} sets a listing's seam {@code id} to
 * {@code slug || uuid}; {@code AdminEnquiries} sends the uuid, because an enquiry row carries
 * {@code propertyId} straight off the wire.
 *
 * <p>The result was two case files for one listing, and <strong>no error on either side</strong>.
 * Each writer read back precisely what it had written, so both surfaces looked correct and neither
 * could notice: the "responded to enquiry" note was filed against a key the review modal's timeline
 * never queried, and simply was not there — which reads exactly like nobody wrote one. That is the
 * same failure {@code V90} was created to end, one layer down.
 *
 * <p>Fixing the one call site would have fixed one call site. This is the {@code ReviewTargetKey}
 * rule applied to notes — <em>accept whatever public identifier the caller already holds; store the
 * key the rest of the schema uses for that thing</em> — so a future caller cannot reintroduce it by
 * passing the other one.
 *
 * <h2>Why an unresolvable id is stored as given rather than refused</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code InternalNoteService} deliberately does not resolve a note's target against its table,
 * and {@code V90} says why: {@code entity_id} is not a foreign key because "a note about a listing
 * that is archived an hour later is precisely the note worth keeping". Existence-checking here
 * would quietly overturn that decision.
 *
 * <p>So this normalises and never rejects. A uuid is kept as-is without a query; a slug that
 * resolves becomes its uuid; anything else is stored verbatim, exactly as it was before this class
 * existed. Archived listings resolve — {@code findBySlug} carries no {@code archived} filter — which
 * matters, because a note taken as a listing is archived is the case the guarantee is about, and
 * resolving it any other way would split the bucket at the one moment it must not.
 *
 * <p>The other kinds have no second spelling: {@code user}, {@code review}, {@code report} and
 * {@code service_request} are addressed by uuid alone. They pass through untouched rather than
 * through a lookup that could only ever return what it was given.
