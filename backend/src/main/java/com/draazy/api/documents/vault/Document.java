/**
 * One file in a property's document vault — a sale deed, an index-II, a society NOC. Maps
 * {@code documents} (V6, tightened by V20).
 *
 * <p><strong>The bytes are not here.</strong> The row stores a {@code storageKey}, an opaque handle
 * into the object store; the {@code url} the client sees is minted per read and expires. That is
 * why there is no {@code url} column: a URL persisted in a row is a permanent, un-revocable
 * credential to a title deed, and the first thing anyone would do is email it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Ids, not associations</strong> — {@code propertyId} is a plain UUID for the same
 * reason as {@code leads.contact.ContactRequest}: the target lives in {@code catalog} and an object
 * reference would hard-wire a cross-context join.
 *
 * <p>{@code uploadedAt} is a distinct column from the inherited {@code createdAt} because V6 made
 * it so; they are set together and only {@code uploadedAt} is on the wire.
