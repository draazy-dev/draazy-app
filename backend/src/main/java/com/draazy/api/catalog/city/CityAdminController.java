/**
 * The back office's two city surfaces: the launch toggle, and the demand behind it.
 *
 * <p><strong>The two methods are guarded differently, and the gap is the point.</strong> Taking a
 * city live is the same class of decision as editing the platform policy document (D192/D13), so
 * {@code PATCH} needs {@code settings:write} on top of the admin role and writes a
 * {@code city.update} audit row. Reading how many people asked for a city is an analytics read, so
 * {@code GET} is staff-visible like {@link Routes.Admin#SUPPLY_GAP} — it renders on the same Supply
 * Gap tab, and an ops operator who can see the gap but not the waitlist gets a screen that
 * half-loads with no way to tell that from nobody having asked.
 *
 * <p>{@code slug} is the primary key, not a display name, so it is matched exactly —
 * {@code /admin/cities/Mumbai} is a 404 and {@code /admin/cities/mumbai} is the city. Normalising
 * it here would invent a second spelling for a key the roster already publishes in {@code GET
 * /cities}.
