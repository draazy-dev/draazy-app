/**
 * {@code GET /admin/supply-gap} — the only read of the anonymous demand table.
 *
 * <p><strong>Guarded as analytics, and not one rung looser.</strong> Ops needs this to
 * do its job — knowing which localities are under-supplied is what listing acquisition is aimed at —
 * so it is staff-visible rather than admin-only. It is not public, and the reason is worth stating:
 * this is a locality-by-locality map of where Draazy has demand it cannot serve, which is the most
 * commercially sensitive thing the platform knows about itself. It is also the report a competitor
 * would most like to have, and unlike revenue it looks innocuous enough to leak by accident.
 *
 * <p>Lives on its own controller rather than as a fourth method on {@code AdminMetricsController},
 * whose docblock opens "the three back-office reporting reads" — a claim worth keeping true.
