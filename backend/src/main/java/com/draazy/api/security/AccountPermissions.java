/**
 * Resolves one back-office account's stored permission document into a yes or no for one
 * {@linkplain BackOfficePermissions atom} (tech debt D192/D13).
 *
 * <h2>Narrowing is the only operation, and it is structural</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #effectiveFor} builds the compiled-in baseline for the caller's role and applies exactly
 * one operation to it: {@code retainAll}. The result is therefore a <strong>subset of the
 * baseline</strong> by construction — not by convention, not by a rule in a comment, but because a
 * set intersection cannot produce a member neither operand had. An administrator who writes
 * {@code settings:write} into a staff account's document has written a string that the intersection
 * drops on the floor, and {@code AccountPermissionsGuardTest} asserts exactly that.
 *
 * <p>This is the property {@code V61} says the old {@code settings.customRoles} model lacked: it
 * composed {@code BASE ∪ role-bundle ∪ moduleAccess}, a union, and honouring a union server-side is
 * the privilege escalation the narrow-only rule exists to prevent. If a later change replaces the
 * {@code retainAll} below with an {@code addAll}, the escalation is back — which is why the
 * narrowing-direction test is written against a route rather than against this method.
 *
 * <p>The second fence is the one that was already there: every atom is {@code and}-ed onto the
 * {@code @PreAuthorize} role guard on its route and never substituted for one. So even a
 * mis-declared ceiling in the catalogue cannot let a staff account reach an admin-only route.
 *
 * <h2>Why the document is read from the database and not from the token</h2>
 *
 * <p>A capability set embedded in a signed JWT is an allow-list the holder carries. Revoking
 * somebody's access would then not take effect until their token expired, and every token in
 * circulation would be a standing snapshot of a policy that has since changed — the exact failure
 * mode {@code V61} warns about when it calls a client-selected bundle "an allow-list the client opts
 * out of". A per-request lookup makes a revocation land on the next request, which is what an
 * access control that exists to be used during an incident has to do. The token shape is unchanged
 * by this slice: it still carries identity and the coarse role, and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Read per call rather than cached, for the same reason {@link PermissionMap} is: a cache here
 * would mean revoking a desk's access and having it keep working for the length of the TTL. The
 * cost is one primary-key lookup against a table with a row per <em>scoped</em> ops account, which
 * on this platform is a table that fits in a page.
 *
 * <h2>How each way of having no answer is answered</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>No row.</strong> The account is not scoped, which is every account until an
 *       administrator scopes one, and the honest reading is "the role baseline applies". Anything
 *       else would have made deploying this migration an outage.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A row whose value is not a JSON array of strings.</strong> <strong>Denies
 *       everything</strong> for that one account. This is the deliberate opposite of
 *       {@link PermissionMap}, whose malformed-document fallback is the role baseline — and the
 *       difference is blast radius. That document is platform-wide and is edited through a web form,
 *       so treating a typo as a lockout would make the class the outage. This one is per-account and
 *       is written by an endpoint that validates every name against the catalogue, so a value the
 *       resolver cannot read can only have arrived by a direct database edit, and the safe reading of
 *       "somebody hand-edited an access-control row into a shape the server does not understand" is
 *       to stop honouring it.</li>
 *   <li><strong>An empty array.</strong> A real, storable state meaning "this account reaches no
 *       guarded back-office route", and it is why a row and no row cannot be the same thing.</li>
 *   <li><strong>A name the catalogue does not contain.</strong> Ignored — it cannot be in the
 *       baseline, so the intersection drops it. Nothing is granted by a name the server does not
 *       enforce, which is what stops a stale console key from ever meaning something.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Anything that is not one of our own principals.</strong> Refused. Unreachable today
 *       (every fragment is {@code and}-ed onto a role guard anonymous cannot pass), but a SpEL
 *       fragment is a string, and the day somebody uses one alone the failure should be a 403.</li>
 * </ol>
