/**
 * The role vocabulary, in both forms the application needs.
 *
 * <p>A role exists as two different strings and that is a genuine trap: the JWT {@code role} claim,
 * the {@code users.role} column, and the JSON the React client reads are all <strong>lower-case</strong>
 * ({@code buyer}/{@code owner}/{@code staff}/{@code manager}/{@code admin}), while
 * Spring Security matches <strong>upper-case</strong> authorities ({@link JwtAuthFilter} grants
 * {@code ROLE_<UPPER>}, and {@code hasRole} re-adds the prefix). Both forms are therefore kept here,
 * side by side, so the relationship is visible and neither can be typo'd in isolation.
 *
 * <p>Both must be compile-time constants: the upper-case form is used inside
 * {@code @PreAuthorize("hasRole(...)")} annotations, so it cannot be derived at runtime with
 * {@code toUpperCase()}.
