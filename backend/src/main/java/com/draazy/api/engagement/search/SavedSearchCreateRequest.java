/**
 * Contract {@code SavedSearchCreate}.
 *
 * <p><strong>{@code query} is conditionally required, which is why it carries no {@code @NotBlank}.</strong>
 * A listings alert is a query string; a flatmates alert is a {@code criteria} object and has no
 * query string to give. The rule "listings needs query, flatmates needs criteria" is enforced in
 * the service (where it can name the missing field) and again by the V27 CHECK constraint.
 *
 * <p>{@code alertFrequency} and {@code channel} are pattern-validated rather than passed through:
 * the CHECK constraints would otherwise reject an unlisted value at insert time, and a constraint
 * violation surfaces as a 500 that any caller could trigger with a typo.
 *
 * @param name            optional user-given name
 * @param kind            {@code listings} (default) or {@code flatmates}
 * @param query           the search text — required when {@code kind} is listings
 * @param filters         optional facet filters (free-form object, stored as jsonb)
 * @param criteria        the flatmates filter set — required when {@code kind} is flatmates
 * @param alertFrequency  default "daily" if absent
 * @param channel         accepted for old clients; saved-search alerts are delivered in-app
