/**
 * The 409 sub-code marker is the <em>last</em> thing in the message, for both sub-codes.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this is a test and not a comment.</strong> Both flatmate conflicts serialise as
 * {@code error: "conflict"}, so the reason travels inside the prose as a trailing {@code (marker)}
 * and the client lifts it out with an end-anchored pattern. "Last" is therefore a contract, and
 * before D182 it was pinned by exactly one assertion that said {@code contains} — which is true of
 * a message with the marker in the middle, and true of a message with a full stop, a trace id or an
 * i18n wrapper bolted on after it. Every one of those changes would have shipped green and turned
 * the benign duplicate back into a red "something went wrong" on the client, which is the precise
 * regression D181 had just removed. {@code group_full} was pinned by nothing at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the client's own pattern is reproduced here.</strong> Asserting {@code endsWith}
 * alone would still pass a message the client cannot parse — say one where the marker had picked up
 * a capital or a hyphen, because {@code conflictSubCode} matches {@code [a-z_]+} and nothing else.
 * Running the real expression is the only way this side can fail for the reason the other side
 * would. It is copied rather than shared because there is no mechanism to share a regex across the
 * two runtimes; the copy is annotated at both ends so an edit to either is visibly an edit to a
 * contract. If the two ever drift, this test is what says so.
 *
 * <p>Plain JUnit, no Spring: {@link FlatmateConflicts} has no collaborators, and the endpoint-level
 * proof that the services actually route through it lives in {@code FlatmateSeekerEndpointsTest},
 * {@code FlatmateSupplyEndpointsTest} and {@code FlatmateDuplicateInterestRaceTest}.
