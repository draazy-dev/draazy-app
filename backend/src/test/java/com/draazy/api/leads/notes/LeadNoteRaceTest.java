/**
 * Two saves of the same annotation, sent together, leave one row and no error.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this race needs no concurrent users.</strong> The find-or-create race in
 * {@code ConversationStartRaceTest} takes two people messaging each other at the same moment; this
 * one takes one person tapping Save twice, or a panel that autosaves the note and the follow-up date
 * from separate controls. Both writes probe {@code findByOwnerIdAndLeadKey}, both miss, both insert,
 * and {@code uq_lead_notes_owner_lead} rejects the second. Left unhandled the owner is told their
 * private note "conflicts with existing data" — a message about contention, for a row nobody else
 * can reach — and the text they typed is gone.
 *
 * <p><strong>Not on {@code AbstractApiTest}, for the same reason as the conversation race.</strong>
 * That base class is {@code @Transactional} and rolls every test back, so its writes are invisible
 * on another connection and a commit-time collision cannot be staged from it at all. Everything here
 * commits for real, which is what {@link #cleanUp()} exists to undo.
