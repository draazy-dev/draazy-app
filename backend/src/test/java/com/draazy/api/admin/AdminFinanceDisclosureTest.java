/**
 * The default half of the D63/D65 disclosure contract: with no configuration at all,
 * {@code /admin/finance} must admit that two of its four money figures are not measured and that
 * revenue excludes the services marketplace.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this needs a test when the values are literals.</strong> The zeros are not what is
 * under test — {@link AdminMetricsEndpointsTest} already pins those. What is under test is that the
 * <em>default</em> is today's truth. A disclosure that defaults to "measured" is worse than no
 * disclosure at all: it is an affirmative claim that a figure means something, made by a system
 * that has no way to produce that figure, and it is exactly the failure a missing default or a
 * typo'd property name would produce silently. The flags read from
 * {@code draazy.finance.*} with a {@code :false} fallback baked into the {@code @Value}.
 *
 * <p><strong>What this class does not cover.</strong> Only that fallback.
 * {@code src/test/resources/application.properties} shadows the main file rather than merging with
 * it, so this context never loads {@code src/main/resources/application.properties} and cannot show
 * that its keys are spelled the way the annotations read them — a singular
 * {@code draazy.finance.refund-measured} in the deployed file would leave this test green and the
 * {@code FINANCE_REFUNDS_MEASURED} override inert. That link is pinned by
 * {@link AdminFinancePropertyContractTest}, which reads both artefacts off disk.
 *
 * <p>The other half — that setting the properties actually flips the response — is
 * {@link AdminFinanceDisclosureEnabledTest}.
