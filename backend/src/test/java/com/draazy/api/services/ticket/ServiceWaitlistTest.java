/**
 * {@code POST /service-waitlist} — the public "tell me when this launches" form (D4).
 *
 * <p><strong>What this endpoint replaces is the reason the tests look the way they do.</strong> The
 * Move-in Pack's coming-soon panel used to write its lead to browser localStorage and then show the
 * customer a success message, so the failure mode was not an error anybody saw — it was a person who
 * believed they were on a list that did not exist. The assertions therefore keep coming back to one
 * question: <em>can ops actually reach this person?</em> {@link #theLeadIsVisibleToTheDeskThatOwnsIt}
 * is the test that would have failed against the old behaviour, and it deliberately reads the row
 * back through the ops board's own endpoint rather than through the repository, because the
 * repository would have been just as happy to prove the existence of a row no screen shows.
 *
 * <p><strong>The rest is about what a stranger controls.</strong> This is the platform's third
 * unauthenticated body-write and the first one that reaches a queue humans work from, so the tests
 * pin the negative: the team cannot be chosen, the subject cannot be composed, the priority cannot
 * be raised, and no free text reaches the board. Those are assertions about the <em>absence</em> of
 * capability, which pass for free if the endpoint is simply broken — so each is paired with a
 * positive anchor proving the row was created at all.
