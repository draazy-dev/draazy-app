/**
 * The way out of {@code awaiting-payment}, and the floor under the cap that guards it — D152 and
 * D153.
 *
 * <p><strong>One suite for two items because they are one situation.</strong> A priced service
 * request is committed unpaid and only the Cashfree webhook moves it on, so closing the modal
 * without paying left the row in a state with no exit: ops cannot see it, {@code PATCH /status} is
 * staff-only, and the one-open-unpaid cap then refused the customer's next attempt while pointing
 * at a request they could do nothing with (D152). The cap that did the refusing was itself
 * check-then-act, so it held against the double click it was written for and not against a loop
 * (D153). Fixing either alone leaves the customer stuck: a cap you cannot get out from under, or an
 * exit from a cap that does not hold.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why there are no threads here</strong> — the same reason {@code OpsQueueConcurrencyTest}
 * has none. A race reproduced with threads is a race reproduced <em>sometimes</em>, and a flaky test
 * guarding concurrency is worse than none. What the D153 fix adds is a uniqueness constraint, and a
 * constraint's whole point is that it does not depend on timing: a second row that would violate it
 * is refused whether it arrives a millisecond later or a day later. So the tests below insert the
 * second row directly, past the service's count, and assert the database's own answer.
 *
 * <p>The sweep is driven by calling {@code expireAbandonedCheckouts(cutoff)} with a fabricated
 * instant rather than by waiting on {@code AbandonedCheckoutSweep}'s schedule — the split between
 * the trigger and the work exists precisely so no test has to wait on a wall clock.
