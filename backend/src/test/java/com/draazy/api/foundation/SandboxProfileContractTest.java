/**
 * {@code application-sandbox.properties} is a near-copy of the prod file, and this test is the price
 * of that.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the duplication exists.</strong> Sandbox used to be activated as {@code
 * prod,sandbox} — a delta that inherited every hardening line from prod and added {@code db/seed}
 * back. That guaranteed the two could never diverge, but it did so by running the profile named
 * {@code prod} against a database full of fabricated listings, which is a confusing thing to have to
 * explain to anyone reading a deployment. The profiles were separated so each environment names
 * exactly one profile and owns its own file.
 *
 * <p><strong>What separation costs.</strong> Inheritance was doing real work: it made drift
 * impossible. Copying the file trades that guarantee for a maintenance hazard whose failure mode is
 * silent and one-directional — someone hardens prod, forgets sandbox, and sandbox quietly stops
 * being a faithful rehearsal of production. Nothing breaks, no test fails, and the environment whose
 * entire purpose is to catch production problems before production does becomes slightly less like
 * production with every such change. By the time it matters, the two files have drifted in a dozen
 * places and nobody knows which differences were deliberate.
 *
 * <p><strong>So this test restores the guarantee as an assertion.</strong> The two files must be
 * byte-for-byte identical in their effective properties except for the keys in {@link
 * #INTENTIONAL_DIVERGENCE}. Adding a line to prod fails this test until the author has either copied
 * it to sandbox or written down, here, why sandbox is different. That is the same protection
 * inheritance gave, except it now also catches the reverse case — a setting loosened in sandbox and
 * never noticed — which the delta arrangement could not see at all.
 *
 * <p>Sibling of {@link ProdProfileContractTest}, which covers the values themselves. This one only
 * covers the <em>relationship</em> between the two files; it deliberately asserts nothing about
 * whether a given value is correct, because duplicating those assertions here would mean two places
 * to update and a second chance to get it wrong.
