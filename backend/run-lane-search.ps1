# Starts the backend for the SEARCH e2e lane: port 8097, database draazy_e2e_sr2,
# build directory target-sr2. Sibling of run-e2e-backend.ps1 (shared :8081 /
# draazy_e2e), run-lane-admin.ps1 (:8084 / draazy_e2e_adm2), run-lane-flatmates.ps1
# (:8095 / draazy_e2e_fm2) and run-lane-services.ps1 (:8096 / draazy_e2e_sv2). This one
# exists so a consumer/search run cannot collide with a concurrent session on any of
# those.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT. e2e/run-live-search.ps1 pins the runner half of this lane; the
# backend half has to agree with it on three values (port, database, build dir).
# Retyping them by hand is how a lane ends up pointed at another session's database, and
# how a JVM ends up outliving the sources it was built from. Neither failure announces
# itself: a stale JVM fails as a scatter of assertion errors that read like code defects.
#
# Pure ASCII on purpose: PowerShell 5.1 parses a BOM-less UTF-8 .ps1 as cp1252, and an
# em-dash inside a double-quoted string terminates it early.
